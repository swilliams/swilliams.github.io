		<p>Most people who have even heard of <a href="http://app.net">it</a> would say that it&rsquo;s a Twitter clone, created out of <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/what-twitter-could-have-been">frustrations over the direction it was heading</a>. Currently, the home page makes it look like an identity and/or messaging service. Over the last couple years, it&rsquo;s bounced around and offered different services. According to the founders, the <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">genesis</a> of it was to create a backend-as-a-service to enable developers to make the next generation of online applications.</p>

<p>The problem was that I don&rsquo;t think App.net ever moved beyond the shadow of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Twitter clone.&rdquo; App.net&rsquo;s API does offer the capabilities to make some really <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">slick</a> <a href="http://favd.net/">apps</a>, but there hasn&rsquo;t been any one thing that captured everyone&rsquo;s attention to make them say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; There is the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/">microblogging service</a>, the <a href="https://omega.app.net/">messaging service</a>, the <a href="https://broadcast.app.net">broadcast service</a>, the <a href="https://backer.app.net/">crowdfunding service</a> and <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/">the cloud storage service</a>. If you&rsquo;re being unkind, you could call them the Twitter clone, the iMessage clone, the Push Notification clone, the Kickstarter clone, and the Dropbox clone. Each of those services are good, but none of them have differentiated themselves from their biggest competitors. If all of those went dark tomorrow, everybody would be able to move back to what they were using before without too much trouble.</p>

<p>There was a great initial fervor when App.net launched. Some big names supported it both vocally and financially. Unfortunately, their engagement petered out over time. The most damning evidence of this? Out of all the people on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801133202/https://join.app.net/">this page</a> the only person who still interacts on App.net regularly is <a href="https://alpha.app.net/garrytan">Garry Tan</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I was very bullish on App.net, which makes the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/">latest news</a> saddening. It isn&rsquo;t the end yet, but when you have literally no employees working on a service and suspend the biggest <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">incentive to develop on your platform</a>, it isn&rsquo;t too far away. Right now the best case I see for App.net is
that it continues along as is, but with little to no growth. I did renew my paid account this year, but I don&rsquo;t know if the service will be around for another renewal next time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like armchair quarterbacking. Saying what <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/woman-a-leading-authority-on-what-shouldnt-be-in-p,35922/">should have been done</a> is too easy and requires no effort on my part. I do think that a lesson to take away from this is that identity is important and needs to be clear to customers.</p>

		<p><a href="http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/6/bio/53">Ed Catmull</a> knows a thing or two about making Great Things. In 2007 he gave a talk at Stanford about how Pixar does their thing. It&rsquo;s almost an hour long but you should watch it.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k2h2lvhzMDc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Some of the things that resonated with me and are just as applicable in other practices:</p>

<p>Present work <em>every day</em>. Even if it is incomplete or sucks. Why? It forces collaboration. If everybody is bumping up against each other, ideas will spread. Problems don&rsquo;t fester either; if someone is struggling on some task for too long it becomes apparent and somebody else can lend a hand if necessary.</p>

<p>Success hides problems. This might be the biggest one. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss problems during times of feast. Catmull also mentioned that they have an open-door policy for everyone and strive to make it safe for <em>everyone</em> to tell the truth. This is hard to do. Even if the CEO&rsquo;s door is open, rank-and-file employees will simply feel <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-hard-could-it-be-how-i-learned-to-love-middle-managers.html?partner=fogcreek">intimidated walking in and stating their mind</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this, Pixar introduced post-morterms; essentially a discussion after the completion of a project to highlight what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. These can be annoying, which means that people will game them, even unintentionally. Pixar found that they had to change up the post-morterms every time in order to get real value from them.</p>

<p>What it boiled down to was that their goal was to create teams of good people that functioned well together. Good people don&rsquo;t tolerate nonsense. If you give a bad idea to a good group, they&rsquo;ll fix it, or throw it away and come up with a better one. A group of mediocre people will take a good idea and screw it up. Therefore, hiring the right people, and then managing them is critical.</p>

<p>Human organziations are inherently unstable and fall over slowly. The fall is slow, but the collapse is quick. The more I experience I get, the more I see people management as a critical role on any project with more than one person. A good project manager constantly takes information from the team and acts on that in order to avoid the fall.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With news of the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">heartbleed vulnerability</a> I&rsquo;ve taken the <strike>paranoid</strike> precautionary measure of changing all my passwords. I have over 200 logins in my <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a><sup>1</sup> library, so I&rsquo;ve seen just about every kind of password change process imaginable over the last day or two. My conclusion is that there are a lot of <strong>terrible</strong> implementations of this process.</p>

<p>Security conflicts with convenience, and changing passwords is never convenient. But there are ways to at least make it quick. Here&rsquo;s what I expect when I got to a site to change my password:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign in.</li>
<li>Click something like &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Account&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Profile&rsquo;. Ideally, there should only be one of those on the page to avoid guessing.</li>
<li>Have the word &lsquo;password&rsquo; on that Settings page. Be it a button, link, or inline form, just make it easy to find.</li>
<li>If I need to enter my old password first, make it the first field.</li>
<li>Display some kind of notification that my change was successful.</li>
<li>Optionally, send me an email telling me it changed, just in case a bad guy did it.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s not so bad right? This has been the standard way of doing things ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgi-bin">cgi-bin</a> was a thing. But so many websites get it wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, <em>have</em> a Change Password form. More than a couple sites I went to don&rsquo;t have one and rely on you to do the Reset My Password dance. This means I have to sign out, go back to the sign in page, click the reset link, enter my email, wait for the email, open the email, click the link in the email, then finally enter a new password. Shame on you if you make me do this. Shame.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict password length. 1Password let&rsquo;s me create a 50 character password, yet I&rsquo;d say at least 40% of the sites I went to couldn&rsquo;t handle a password that long.</li>
<li>If you have to restrict length for some reason, tell me exactly what that maximum is.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
    <img alt="Password WTF" src="/images/assets/password-wtf.png" />
</figure>


<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict what characters I can use. There is no technical reason I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to use spaces or symbols in a password.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict copy/paste in the password field. Paypal was the only one I saw that did this, and it boggles my mind. A random, complex password is going to be more secure than one I can easily type in (which can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_tables">cracked quickly</a>). Don&rsquo;t actively prevent me from trying to make my financial data secure!</li>
</ul>


<p>Security already has its own set of barriers, and a certain subset of people will never take it seriously. As a web developer, it is entirely up to you to keep that subset from growing in size.</p>

<time datetime="2014-03-06T13:13:51-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 6<span>th</span>, 2014</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the <a href="/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages">pre-history</a>, and then the <a href="/words/2014/01/25/my-computers-through-the-ages-part-ii">awkward years</a>. Now we come at last to the present. From here on out, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> all the way down, so if that ruins your day, please feel free to stop reading and go outside to contemplate your existance.</p>

<p>Why did I switch? Most of it came down to what I use a computer for. I&rsquo;m a software developer by trade. The first part of my career was mostly in the Microsoft stack, but by the late 2000&rsquo;s I got the itch to move on to <a href="/words/2013/12/02/the-frustrations-of-the-journeyman/">something else</a>. Every kind of development platform that I&rsquo;m interested in runs better on a Unix-like system. Apple doesn&rsquo;t make me happy 100% of the time, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be leaving their ecosystem for a while.</p>

<p><strong>24&#8221; iMac</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp507">(2009)</a> I&rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting when I made the switch, but I wasn&rsquo;t terribly fond of this one. The hardware was great; a beautiful display, pretty fast processor, and a spacious hard drive. I loved that I didn&rsquo;t have a beige butt-ugly tower on my desk anymore. My frustrations were entirely with OS X.  It came with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/">10.5 Leopard</a>, with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/snowleopard/">10.6 Snow Leopard</a> released shortly after the computer showed up on my porch. After upgrading, it had a myriad of reliability problems. What made me grind my teeth were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_panic">kernel panics</a>. A kernel panic is an error in the Operating System that it cannot recover from, stopping everything and requiring a restart. You might be familiar with its colloquial name on Windows: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_XP_BSOD.png">Blue Screen of Death</a>. I would average one of those every month on my iMac, which is astronomically high for an OS marketed with <a href="http://a3.img.mobypicture.com/570253fecab177d9605be5d157c59e18_view.jpg">&ldquo;it just works&rdquo;</a> as its slogan.</p>

<p>It frustrated me enough that I considered going back to Windows. What held me back was that I had started getting more and more into <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> development, which (still) doesn&rsquo;t run very well on Windows<sup>1</sup>. I had started to work on a <a href="/words/2013/12/26/whither-shootsy-or-how-i-tried-and-failed-a-startup">Rails based project</a> that would have benefited from having a laptop in order to work outside the house. Despite my initial reservations for OS X, I doubled down.</p>

<p><strong>13&#8221; MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp583">(2010)</a> This was the cheapest Mac laptop at the time. With impeccable timing, I bought this right before Apple released the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Airs</a>. This wasn&rsquo;t a particularly fast computer, but it showed me how well OS X could work when it doesn&rsquo;t constantly blow up. I don&rsquo;t know if my iMac was a bit of a lemon, or if OS X just works better on laptops, but it was noticeable.</p>

<p>It also made me realize that I could get by with just a laptop. Syncing data between two computers is a bit of a pain, even with things like Dropbox and source control management. On more than one occasion I had to call my wife and walk her through performing an <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/a-tour-of-mercurial-the-basics.html#x_68"><code>hg push</code></a> in order to send me the latest bits of a project. I held on to this computer for a little while and then sold it to put together enough scratch for the next one.</p>

<p><strong>15&#8221; MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp620">(2011)</a> I went laptop only for the first time with this computer. It was my workhorse for almost 3 years. On it, I created Rails apps, iOS apps, and even managed to use it with my day job in .NET-land (through VMWare). It was reliable as a rock even with me mucking around inside it to upgrade the memory and hard drive. Even though I had this computer longer than most others, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot to say about it, which is a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>13&#8221; MacBook Pro w/Retina</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP691">(2014)</a> Here we are (finally) in the present. I didn&rsquo;t think the retina screen would be that much of a deal breaker, but I&rsquo;d rather sell my left foot than give it up now. I can leave my power cord at home and fit in an entire work day on the battery. Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s also crazy fast despite only having a dual-core CPU (my last one was a quad). All of that comes in a package just under 3.5 pounds. I&rsquo;ve only had this computer for a couple of months, but it&rsquo;s already the best one I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring. I like the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, but not enough to spring for its $3000+ price tag. And I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d go back to a desktop again. I&rsquo;d like to hold onto this laptop for as long as I can.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. Rails by itself runs fine on Windows. It&#8217;s when you start adding gems into the mix that things start going hinky. And then there&#8217;s the whole cygwin thing. Ugh.

<p>Why? Well, for starters, it&rsquo;s slow to use. I think it&rsquo;s a byproduct of the way they organized their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page application</a> architecture. I find myself having to wait for things to open in modal windows, or to load another menu.</p>

<p>The layout tools are bad. If all you do is write text and link to stuff, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. Sometimes I like to have <a href="/words/2014/01/26/demystifying-ruby-dsls">in depth coding posts</a> that have multiple blocks of code within them. This is incredibly painful to do with the Squarespace layout tools. Here&rsquo;s the process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hover over an existing text block.</li>
<li>Click the appropriate &ldquo;+&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Scroll down to find the &ldquo;CODE&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Paste in the code (after making sure the indentation is correct)</li>
<li>Go to step 1 and this time, select Markdown.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat for <em>every</em> block and image you want.</li>
</ol>


<p>What you see is <em>definitely not</em> what you get. Sizing images to align to the left or right of a paragraph is awful. For some reason, the editing font on the admin page is different than the one on the actual site. This means that even if everything lines up on the admin page, it might not on the live site. Fixing this is tedious. Again, due to the single-pagedness of the admin site, you can&rsquo;t easiliy open the preview in a new tab or window (&lsquo;Open in new page&rsquo; does nothing). You need to open a brand new browser window, navigate to your admin site, then click on the preview button there.</p>

<p>Saving a post in the editor closes the modal that contains it. This means that the workflow for making any kind of adjustment is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the thing above to get a second window open to look at the preview.</li>
<li>Click the post in the first window to edit.</li>
<li>Wait a second.</li>
<li>Find the typo to fix. This is extra fun if you have multiple blocks of text.</li>
<li>Fix the typo and hit save. (Modal closes)</li>
<li>Switch over to the preview in the second window and refresh.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s not right, repeat steps 2-6 until it is.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of this for about $100/year (or more).</p>

<p>Octopress is a static site generator that is aimed at developers. If you don&rsquo;t know <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, as well as HTML + CSS consider something else. However, since I am familiar with all of those, it works for me.</p>

<p>The problem is exporting my content from Squarespace. The only export option available is one for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, which dumps everything into an XML file. Since I&rsquo;m not using Wordpress, this didn&rsquo;t work for me. My blog has been quite the sojourner, created orginally on Wordpress, then to Posterous (lol), and finally Squarespace. It&rsquo;s accumulated a bit of cruft. For some reason, older posts did not export properly; if they contained an image and text, the text was deleted.</p>

<p>After some fiddling, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter">script</a> that would walk each post on the blog, download everything and then move onto the next. I did run into some gotchas though:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of the older images were named &ldquo;#img.jpg&rdquo;. I ended up <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L151">generating</a> a random string for the filename and removing the hashtag.</li>
<li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags used a <code>data-src</code> attribute instead of a standard <code>src</code> attribute. <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L181">The fix was to rename the attribute</a>.</li>
<li>There was a veritable boatload of extra markup and attributes on each post, which made things look weird. I ended up parsing the entire HTML of each post and <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L223">stripping</a> out all the unnecessary stuff.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are still some issues that I&rsquo;ll need to address on a case by case basis, but it&rsquo;s a good 80% solution right now.</p>

<p>I like Octopress because it is fast, easy for me to manage, and keeps my content in a simple (and portable) format. I just hope that this will last me for a while. It doesn&rsquo;t do nearly as many things as Squarespace, but most of those I don&rsquo;t need.</p>

		<p><a href="/words/2014/01/26/demystifying-ruby-dsls">Last time we learned about how to use modules to dynamically add functionality to a class</a>. This time let&rsquo;s take a look at doing that, but customizing our extensions at runtime.</p>

<p>What helped me ultimately understand how these things work is that you are building up classes on the fly. It&rsquo;s kind of like when you <code>include</code> a module, it&rsquo;s editing that class to add more methods to it. Think of a bunch of Legos. Each Lego is a module with various methods on it. At runtime they assemble together to build a castle.</p>

<h3>Dynamically Adding</h3>

<p>What if those Legos could generate even more Legos as you were building with them, and then intelligently join themselves together?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with Rails, you&rsquo;ve seen that you can just declare associations within a model — <code>:has_many</code>, <code>:has_one</code>, and so on. Once you add those directives to your class, suddenly you have access to brand spanking new methods. Have you ever wondered how that worked? Let&rsquo;s implement a rudimentary version.</p>

<p>Think for a moment about <code>:has_many</code>. What would you expect the line <code>has_many :gerbils</code> methods to do?  You would have to have a <code>gerbils</code> method to retrieve the little fellas, and another one, <code>gerbils=(new_value)</code> to set them (and others to add them and so on, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_it_simple_stupid">KISS</a>). You implement that with a generic <code>get_child_models(child_name)</code> method, but that feels like the Java (™ Oracle Corporation) way&hellip; and I have too much self respect to go down that path. Instead we can take advantage of Ruby&rsquo;s metaprogramming capabilities and generate them dynamically.</p>

<p>One way to do this is with <code>eval</code>.</p>

<h3>A Word on Eval</h3>

<p>Ruby has a few versions of <code>eval</code>. They all take strings or blocks and turn them in code that is executed.</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Kernel.html#method-i-eval">standard one</a> that executes arbitrary code.</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Module.html#method-i-class_eval">class_eval</a> — similar to vanilla <code>eval</code>, but executes the code in the context of the Class itself. There&rsquo;s also <code>module_eval</code> which does the same thing (more or less). Example:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="">instance_eval</a> — modifies a class, but from an instance point of view, <em>and only for that particular instance</em> (this is called a <a href="http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/39-ruby-s-object-model/lessons/131-singleton-methods-and-metaclasses">Singleton method</a>).</li>

<p>Using these techniques you can generate the set of methods for our <code>:has_many</code> implementation.</p>

<p>Now, if you <code>include Associations</code> in your class, you can call <code>has_many :hamsters</code> or <code>has_many :gerbils</code> or <code>has_many :guinea_pigs</code> and have all of your getters and setters created.</p>

    <img alt="This is you with all the gerbil methods." src="/images/assets/cashew.jpg">
    <figcaption>This is you with all the gerbil methods.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Caution</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of <code>eval</code>, at least when using it with strings. The biggest reason is that it makes bugs harder to find. The Ruby interpreter will point out syntax errors when the file loads, but a typo in an evalled string won&rsquo;t get caught until runtime. The longer the string, the more likely something bad will creep in there. And some of these dynamically created methods will be long. I&rsquo;m talking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026L7H20/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0026L7H20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Lord of the Rings Extended Edition</a> long.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a better way. The eval methods also take blocks, which work pretty well in most cases. For the purposes of dynamically generating methods, I prefer using <code>define_method</code> <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Module.html#method-i-define_method">source</a>. It&rsquo;s available on <code>Module</code> (and therefore classes too) and, just like it says on the tin, is designed to create methods on the fly and add them to a class.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s kinda similar to the eval code, in fact, <code>define_method</code> passes itself along to <code>instance_eval</code>, so when all is said and done, it&rsquo;s merely for our convenience. But is easier to test, and will complain loudly if there&rsquo;s a syntax error.</p>

<p>Working with actual code rather than a string makes refactoring easier too. Let&rsquo;s say you want to enable your users to define their own implementations of the generated rodent methods. Pulling that out into its own method is simple:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s still possible with string evals, but is easier to read in my eyes.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;ll wrap up this entry on DSLs. There&rsquo;s only one other big piece of the pie I&rsquo;d like to cover — blocks, but you can do a whole lot without them.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind when writing DSLs is that it can be hard to follow along. Document everything, especially the esoteric parts. It might even be a good idea to diagram the path of all the <code>include</code> chain. DSLs can make client code easier to write, but usually at the expense of crazy complexity within the DSL itself.</p>

<p>And so on. At first glance, the code that allows this can be intimidating, especially when it&rsquo;s been broken up and refactored across 20 different classes and modules. Fortunately, there are probably only about 10 things that you really need to know to read along, and to make them yourself.</p>

<h3>Class Methods</h3>

<p>Did you know that you can execute code right from within a class declaration? Well, you can. Try it!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Derp</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I LOVE CATS&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When that class is read by the interpreter, it&rsquo;ll execute the <code>can_eat_sandwiches</code> method and print the non-sequitur to the console. This&rsquo;ll even work through inheritance.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Herp</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Derp</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you&rsquo;ll have a wonderful message printed out twice. This technique can be used to do more than just clutter up a log file too! For example, in Rails when you <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9c025ab6e9731dde56186b41ba5d4f216a48c831/activemodel/lib/active_model/validations.rb#L140">setup validation</a>, all you&rsquo;re doing is calling another method.</p>

<h3>Put it into a Module</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to add functionality to a class without locking it into a long inheritance chain. Ruby uses <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_modules.htm">Modules</a> to accomplish this, so you can pull your methods into a separate file to include them at will. There&rsquo;s a catch though before you dive in. Traditionally, you&rsquo;d include a module like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">TheHerppening</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Sandwichable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">TheHerppening</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you know how modules work, you might&rsquo;ve noticed that will only add <code>can_eat_sandwiches</code> to <em>instances</em> of <code>Sandwichable</code>, not to <code>Sandwichable</code> itself. Which means that calling <code>can_eat_sandwiches</code> directly in the class won&rsquo;t work. But fear not! Ruby can be molded in many dark and fearsome ways. Rather than using <code>include</code>, you can use <code>extend</code> to add methods to a class.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Sandwichable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">TheHerppening</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Aaaaand we&rsquo;re back in business. But, say you wanted to have some methods that needed to be on instances, and some for the class? Can you mix both? Sure. Just wrap them in different modules and add them with the appropriate calls. There&rsquo;s even a pattern to follow for naming the modules: <code>ClassMethods</code> and <code>InstanceMethods</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">TheHerppening</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">ClassMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;DING&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">InstanceMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">eat_the_sandwich</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;I wish I could marry a sandwich.&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>They can even be in the same file. As a side note, this is also how you can do namespacing in Ruby. Including these can be a little tedious if you have to add this to lots of classes.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Sandwichable</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="ss">TheHerppening</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ClassMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="ss">TheHerppening</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:InstanceMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">can_eat_sandwiches</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Not to mention ugly. And if there&rsquo;s one thing a good Ruby coder can&rsquo;t stand, it&rsquo;s ugly code. Let&rsquo;s fix that.</p>

<p><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Module.html">Modules</a> (and classes) have all kinds of meta-programming capabilities built in. I encourage you to go and peruse them at your leisure. What we&rsquo;ll focus on here is the <code>[included](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Module.html#method-i-included)</code> method.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Dingus</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="nb">self</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">included</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">base</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">base</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span> <span class="ss">:include</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">Dingus</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:InstanceMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">base</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span> <span class="ss">Dingus</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ClassMethods</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All of a sudden, your class now has all of the extra stuff from the <code>Dingus</code> module inside it.</p>

<p>That might be jumping ahead a few steps, what with the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> and all. Don&rsquo;t forget that in Ruby, <em>everything</em> is a class, even modules. Conceptually it might be easier to understand if you look at <code>Module</code>&rsquo;s ancestors:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="no">Module</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ancestors</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="no">Module</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Object</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">PP</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ObjectMixin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Kernel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">BasicObject</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, a <code>Module</code> is just a subclass of <code>Object</code> and can be treated as such. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFNEgdwjEhs">Whoa</a>. Specifically, the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> allows you to put class level methods on the module (you can also do this to a class as an alternative to <code>def self.whatevers</code>).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Dingus</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="nb">self</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_hi</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s1">&#39;HI&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Dingus</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">say_hi</span> <span class="c1"># HI</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And, <code>included</code> is called when that module is included in a class. This means you can set off a chain reaction of includes with just a single one.</p>

<p>This is just the start. Ruby gives you enough metaprogramming rope to build a hammock and then hang yourself with the leftovers. We&rsquo;ll get into some of the other ways to do this later on, including <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4911353/736">blocks</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Kernel.html#method-i-eval">eval</a>, and the infamous <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing">method-missing</a>. I encourage you to start digging into some code, and even trying a little of this yourself. Once you get a few reps in, understanding how DSLs work becomes much easier.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In <a href="/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages">Part 1</a> I talked about my first few computers. They were an important part of my childhood, and shaped the person I would become and the career I chose. When I went to college I started to build and upgrade my own PCs. Things went well enough at first, but then got a little out of hand.</p>

<h3>Dark Ages</h3>

<p><strong>Custom PC #1</strong> (2000) Since I was still in college, I didn&rsquo;t have very much money and bought some dirt cheap parts from websites that may have been run by questionable companies. These parts were leftover from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oem">OEMs</a> and didn&rsquo;t have real retail boxes. Some would just show up with a minimal layer of bubble wrap around the bare hardware. I had bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_iii">Pentium III CPU</a>, but screwed up putting the heatsink on it. It was too unstable to run at its advertised speed, so I had to <em>underclock</em> it or it&rsquo;d just lock up the whole system within minutes. It could run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena">Quake 3</a> well enough though at that speed.</p>

<p><strong>Custom PC #2</strong> (2001) If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed right? This was the only time I strayed away from the Intel and bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd_athlon">AMD Athlon processor</a>. I had learned from my mistake and assembled it correctly, but it also had problems and would lock up at odd times. I remember trying to show my parents just what a computer could do by playing an assortment of Led Zeppelin mp3s, and halfway through Stairway it froze and needed to be restarted. I was either not a very good PC builder or kept buying crummy parts. Probably a little from column A and a little from column B.</p>

<p>I hit the nadir of my computer history while putting this computer together. During the assembly I saw that there were some weird red splotches on the inside of the case but couldn&rsquo;t figure out what they were. More started to appear and then I realized that I had cut my hand on a sharp hunk of metal from the bargain basement case and I was bleeding all over it.</p>

<h3>Working Stiff</h3>

<p><strong>Custom PC #3</strong> (2004) I had a real jobby-job and was earning more than the $Nothing I was in college, so I was finally able to afford computer parts that came in actual boxes, and wouldn&rsquo;t require keeping a roll of bandages nearby. I went back to Intel and got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_IV">Pentium 4</a> to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_xp">Windows XP</a>. This was my first DIY computer that actually ran ok. It was also the first time I used an LCD monitor. The <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-1905fp/4505-3174_7-31232074.html">19&#8221; Dell Ultrasharp</a> was a big upgrade to the cumbersome CRTs I had been using.</p>

<p><strong>Custom PC #4</strong> (2007) My last Windows PC, and also the best. My brother-in-law worked at Intel and as &ldquo;payment&rdquo; for taking some pictures at his wedding gave me a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2_duo#Core_2_Duo">Core 2 Duo</a> CPU. The prior one worked well enough, but was very loud. Pentium 4&rsquo;s were known to run hot, and my case required a number of fans to keep mine from melting through to the Earth&rsquo;s core. The Core 2 Duo was much quieter.</p>

<p>Honestly, there wasn&rsquo;t anything very memorable about this one. It was a Camry — reliable, but otherwise unremarkable.</p>

<p>Things were starting to change for me. I had been a software developer working in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft stack</a> for a long time and felt a seven year itch to move on to different things.</p>

<h3>Fruit</h3>

<p>I never liked Apple computers. When I was growing up in the early-mid 90s, it was the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; times for Apple, when they kept releasing unremarkable computers with ancient notions of software. Even when Steve Jobs returned,  I thought of them as too expensive and fluffed up with a bunch of annoying marketing. I especially despised the original iMac<sup>1</sup> with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nS4EGKU04">goofy colors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_USB_Mouse">awful mouse</a>, and thought that it was dead in the water because it lacked a floppy drive. This wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a technical prediction of mine was hilariously off base.</p>

<p>As time went on I did start to like the industrial design of a few models. The original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Titanium_PowerBook_G4">Titanium Powerbooks</a> (so thin!), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_cube">G4 Cube</a> looked especially nice to my eyes, but they were still way too expensive for my budget.</p>

<p>Around the time they switched over to Intel processors I started to reconsider my position. I liked that they were <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html">Unixy</a>, making certain kinds of web development easier. Eventually, some of the more garish designs of OS X were <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/3/">stripped back</a>, and I decided to make the leap.</p>

<p>Apple recently celebrated the <a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/">30th anniversary of the original Macintosh</a>. I joined the Mac train in 2009, and have [mostly] liked it ever since. Next time I&rsquo;ll go into the specifics of the Macs that I&rsquo;ve owned, and why I recommend them.</p>
