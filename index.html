		<p>It was time for my one-on-one with Ron and I could tell it would be a doozy. He slumped into a chair and before I could even start with a basic “how’s it going?” he launched into a tirade about Sales and how they were screwing us over <em>again</em> and that he had to pick up the extra load. This is a not exactly a unique case—there’s a natural tension between promise and delivery and there’s more than a kernel of truth to it. Ron was really steamed this time though. It could be he needed to vent, but maybe he was just whining.</p>

<p>I don’t like whining. I have two kids who are approaching teenage-dom, and I have enough of it in my life already, thank you very much. Whining from adults is especially grating—they should know better, but it still happens.</p>

<p>I view whining as subtly but distinctly different from venting. And what is that difference you ask? Whining focuses on “woe is me!” and doesn’t lend itself to finding solutions. A whiner wants everything and everyone around them to change to accommodate themselves and their needs. Further, whining tends to beget more whining; whereas when a good old fashion vent is complete, progress can be made. Venting can be healthy.</p>

<p>I actually kinda like hearing a good <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/">vent</a> session. If someone is venting to me directly, then it means they have some level of <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2018/11/01/building-trust-on-teams/">trust</a> with me. They’re opening up and spilling out a little bit of themselves. This means you need to be wearing your listening hat. Vents can get emotional—this is good—it means the venter is invested deeply in something and that they care. So, listen! With empathy!</p>

<p>As you’re listening (with empathy), consider the context. They have their point of view and you have yours. They are much closer to the ground floor of the situation they are experiencing, but as a manager you Know Things that they may not. You can use this knowledge to nudge the conversation and keep it a vent rather than a whine, but don’t try to fix the problem. Something incredible can happen when someone is venting: by talking through it they may discover a solution all on their own. This is good. If it sounds like therapy, it kind of is!</p>

<p>Can you turn a whine into a vent? I think you can, but it may be a struggle. Sometimes it may be asking a pointed question: “Oh wow, that <em>is</em> a mess… what can we do to tweak it a bit?” Dig in and ask constructive questions, though try to steer things towards the realm of productivity. If you have a strong enough relationship consider plainly stating it, “this almost sounds like a whine. Is there a way to frame it so that there is the potential for a solution here?” It may not work, but that’s a whole other ball of wax.</p>

<p>Fortunately, once Ron got it all off his chest he calmed down a bit and evaluated his own communication with the sales team. It wasn’t actually the end of the world (this time), and he picked up a few pointers for how to work a little more effectively with them in the next go around.</p>

		<p>Let’s talk about trust. Team members who trust each other feel psychologically safe. This means they’ll be emboldened to act as themselves without fear of blowback or negative repercussions. They’ll focus on the work in front of them without worrying about their boss or co-workers blasting them for it, even if they make mistakes. The opposite is a detriment &ndash; they burn too much time double and triple checking every last bit of communication making sure it falls in line with arbitrary office politics.</p>

<p>One of the pillars of psychological safety is trust. Trust that happens  between manager and employee, and also trust from team member to team member. That kind of trust takes time to build up, but the good news is that the process can begin at any time.</p>

<h2>Tell them the things you probably don’t want to</h2>

<p>I like to tell my teams the things I’m nervous about. At one team meeting, I spoke at length of the actions the company can take to “spy” on employees, such as that their inbox is forwarded to me once they leave the company or that all it takes is a few clicks from the IT department and I could read every single email or slack message that they have sent. Most of the team already knew that in theory, but hearing from me just how <em>simple</em> it is was a bit of an eye opener. I also said how many times I had personally taken those measures (very, very rarely, and only for good reasons).</p>

<p>It was a bit of an awkward conversation, but it engendered trust between all of us because they knew what kind of power I could wield, even if I rarely used it. It also gave them an understanding of what they’d need to be cautious of if they needed to have a truly <em>private</em> conversation with me or each other. Understanding what kind of privacy you do or do not have is important for trust.</p>

<h2>Ask if they understand their part in the company’s bottom line</h2>

<p>It’s good for one to know, whether significant or not, how their work impacts how your company makes money. I like to ask this question in my 1:1s with my direct reports and the answers are occasionally surprising. It might be obvious to you, the manager, how the corporate machine works, but for a worker it may not be.</p>

<p>Here’s an example: I’ve worked in service organizations for most of my career. At a basic level,  this means you track the hours you work for a client and that time is billed to them. Relatively straightforward, but there are many more details that go in to the equation. What happens if deadlines are missed? What happens if a client is NET 180 (meaning they don’t pay invoices for 180 days &ndash; half a year(!))? And, if that’s the case, how does that affect the company’s revenue and reporting, because brother you better believe it does.</p>

<p>Even if an employee is “just” a tiny cog in a massive machine, it’s beneficial for them to understand how their contribution helps the wheels of the company turn. Knowing that their work is important to someone somewhere allows them to take pride in what they do &ndash; their work matters! (If their work doesn’t actually matter… then you should fix that)</p>

<h2>Be honest when delivering bad news, but not too honest</h2>

<p>If you’re a manager, you’ll probably know about bad news first. Don’t sugar coat it or try to spin it into a positive if there isn’t a silver lining. “We’re gonna miss our target for the quarter. That ain’t great.” Rather than “Team, I’m very excited about a big opportunity for us to demonstrate our grit and perseverance to our customer base and blah blah blah.” Employees are smart and will sniff out the BS… and when that happens, trust plummets.</p>

<p>It’s ok to say what you’re feeling, but be careful if things aren’t looking good. “We missed our numbers and it’s sales’s fault and I think we’re screwed” might seem true in the moment but it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy even when that particular situation might have still had hope. If your own personal cynicism and pessimism is leaking out in your communication, you’re not doing your job as a leader. Your duty to your team is to motivate them and to empower them to do good work. Instead, “Look, we missed our target, and that’s not good. I’m nervous and I’m also a little scared because it means things could get worse for us. BUT, there <em>is</em> a way out and here’s what we’re gonna do…” conveys the seriousness of the situation, as well as your own personal feelings, but also presents a path forward so that people don’t just dwell on the crisis.</p>

<p><em>[Note: if it is catastrophic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/telltale-employees-left-stunned-by-company-closure-no-1829272139">like the whole company is shutting down</a>, treat people like adults and deliver that news promptly so that they don’t have to panic and scramble to find new jobs.]</em></p>

<p>This list is not exhaustive, but I have found these things to be particularly effective. Trust is built up over time. It takes constant care and attention to grow, must be demonstrated consistently, and can be lost in a heartbeat if you ever stop treating your employees like the fully actualized humans that they are.</p>

		<p>When I&rsquo;m hiring, I hear this one a lot. A candidate is nervous about something that I just asked, let&rsquo;s use <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> as an example, about and they&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about GraphQL, but I&rsquo;m a fast learner!!&rdquo; and their earnestness nearly jumps out of their body and does a little dance.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. I hear that phrase <em>all the time</em>. I imagine so does every other hiring manager. And this may sound mean, but so what? If everyone is truly a fast learner, what separates you from the rest? Also, I can probably find someone who already knows GraphQL in the stack of resumes I&rsquo;m procrastinating in sifting through. What&rsquo;s my motivation to keep going with you?</p>

<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely harsh, but it&rsquo;s reality. Hiring managers are usually stressed and need to find the right person very badly. Here&rsquo;s a way to play to that need and flip the situation. Start with this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wow, it sounds like GraphQL is a bigger deal for this role than I originally thought, and it sounds like I&rsquo;m a little out of my depth. This still sounds like a dynamite job though, so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do: Tonight I&rsquo;m going to watch the <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> series on GraphQL. Then over the next week I&rsquo;m going to build a little project that consumes the GitHub GraphQL API. I&rsquo;ll send it to you if you&rsquo;re still interested. How does that sound?</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fast learner, please hire me.&rdquo; It acknowledges the problem (a gap in expectations), and then presents a solid plan for how to overcome it. Further, that candidate shows crazy kinds of initiative, as well as a strong desire for the job, without coming off as begging. And lastly, it&rsquo;d show me some code, which is very useful when hiring a developer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a guarantee that you&rsquo;ll get the gig, but will at least impress the interviewer.</p>

<p>Other things:</p>

<p>If the job description wasn&rsquo;t clear about the requirements for GraphQL in the first place&hellip; that&rsquo;s a miss on the hiring manager&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>Also, that response presumes that the candidate has the free-time to do all that, which is not the case for everybody.</p>

		<p>I have a weird fascination with high altitude/cold weather disasters and mysteries. I’ve watched every documentary on Netflix about Everest disasters, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70268450?trackId=13752289&amp;tctx=0%2C0%2Cfcfcdc13-2e02-4aa4-be4f-53f68f4238ee-107915969">K2 disasters</a>, read Krakauer’s books, and I still can’t get enough of the stuff. I&rsquo;ve watched so many that they&rsquo;ve started to all blur together, and I have trouble remembering which is which&hellip; I’m not sure why I find it all so fascinating; I have no interest in actually going and having those adventures, but something about confronting those extremes are just interesting to me.</p>

<p>I also dig unexplained phenomenons. I watched a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_Mysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a> as a kid, and they always stuck with me. So, the story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident">Dyatlov Pass Incident</a> is right in my wheelhouse. The gist is: in 1959 a group of Russian college students went on a long hike/camping trip through the Ural Mountains. One night they all abandoned their tent and ran out in the middle of the night in -40 degree weather without shoes or proper cold-weather gear on. They were discovered a month later buried in the snow, and nobody could figure out the cause. They were all experienced campers in a very remote region. Theories included avalanche, a lovers quarrel, wild animals, indigenous people turned murders, the KGB, rogue science experiments gone wrong, and, of course, aliens.</p>

<p>So, it was only natural that I’d be interested in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Mountain-Untold-Dyatlov-Incident-ebook/dp/B00CUSQOA0/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=dead%2Bmountain%2Bthe%2Buntold%2Btrue%2Bstory%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bdyatlov%2Bpass%2Bincident&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;qid=1516651192">Dead Mountain &ndash; The Untold True Story of the Dyatlov Pass Incident</a>. The author goes through meticulous detail to find out everything he possibly could about the expedition, the rescue (and then recovery) party, and his own experiences traveling to Russia to try to retrace some of their steps 50 years later.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading this. The author provided enough context of the group, their motivations, and the climate of the Soviet Union at the time without going too far off the rails. He also breaks down each theory, even some of the outlandish ones, and points out the strengths and flaws in each of them.</p>

<p>My favorite chapter came towards the end when he switches into speculation mode, and weighs all of the facts and evidence and then comes up with a plausible explanation. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it seems convincing.</p>

<p>If you’re into this kind of thing, it’s worth checking out.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Hollywood also made a movie “about” the story a few years ago. I didn’t see that one, but it included time-travel and teleporting mutants apparently. I think we can rule that one out.</p>

<p><em>[One of my goals for 2018 is to read 12 books in the year. Some of you may scoff at that number but while I love to read, I haven’t had time as of late to indulge in that. This year I am making the time.]</em></p>

		<p>I see a lot of resumés. <a href="https://tallwave.com">We&rsquo;re a growing company</a>, and <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/tallwave.com">are hiring often</a>, so the rate of resumés that cross my desk has only gone up. I care quite a bit about my team and hire with great care, so I say &lsquo;no&rsquo; most of the time. If you wanted to know how to get a leg up on my hiring process, and perhaps others&#8217;, here&rsquo;s how I scan and determine pass/reject on resumés.</p>

<p><em>[Note: this is <strong>my</strong> process. I am not stating it is the best or that it will work in any other situation. This is just how I do it.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Reject the grossly unqualified. These are the people who may very well have applied for the wrong job by accident, or just don&rsquo;t care and apply to every single job they can find. The most memorable of these was someone who&rsquo;s closest relevant experience to a senior developer position was that they were a college mascot&hellip;</p>

<p>Also, double check to make sure you find and replace the right strings in your cover letter. &ldquo;I really want to work at [Some Other Company]!&rdquo; looks bad on you. Speaking of cover letters:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Reject those who don&rsquo;t read the job description. I include a blurb like this on every job description I post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Do not just send in a resume. Tell us your story. What have you built that makes you proud? How have you demonstrated leadership? What are your aspirations? What are you passionate about? What are you dying to learn next? Share with us the stuff that makes you stand out. This could be something as simple as a well-crafted cover letter, or something public that you had a hand in creating.</p></blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many people don&rsquo;t do any of that (or actually, if you&rsquo;ve ever hired anyone before, you are completely not surprised in the least). If there is nothing but a resume attached, it goes in the reject pile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you automatically disqualify people without even reading their names?&rdquo; you say? Well, in this job, the details matter. If you are the type of person that does not read that, you are not going to do <a href="https://tallwave.github.io/guidelines/Quality">well</a> by our clients, and that is just not gonna fly.</p>

<p>Those two steps will whittle down a pool of 200 applicants to 20 or so. I want to get that number down to below 10. The next steps are a little more involved. But before that, there are a couple of smaller things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>How much school stuff should I put include?</strong>. School kinda matters for an entry-level job. The school, your GPA, and if what you studied is related to the job are data points, but not deciding factors. Graduating summa cum laude from MIT is a nice feather in your cap, but it does not guarantee that you are a good software developer.</p>

<p>Nobody cares about your high school. Seriously. Don&rsquo;t put it on your resumé.</p>

<p><strong>Bits and bobs</strong>. Have up to date contact information on there. That includes easy URLs to any social media you feel like sharing. If I&rsquo;m interested, I&rsquo;ll try to look you up on LinkedIn. Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to glean information there than a resumé.</p>

<p>Ok, more important stuff now.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. More Hemingway, less Faulkner. I will not be spending more than a few minutes at this stage on your resume. I do not have the time to read your 5000 word treatise on how awesome you are. It is possible to convey your passion for the craft in a couple of paragraphs, I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>

<p>Also, take 5 minutes and do a Google search on the company and position you&rsquo;re applying for. &ldquo;I saw that you recently did [some thing] and I love [key component of it]. I&rsquo;d like to talk about that!&rdquo; Flattery will get you everywhere, and this is the easiest way to get in the good graces of the person screening resumés.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Evaluate skills and job history. If I&rsquo;m hiring a web developer, can you, y&#8217;know, develop software for the web? When I&rsquo;m doing this I&rsquo;m looking for something that makes you stand out to me. Do your best to make this easy for me. &ldquo;I designed and built a load balanced RESTful API that scaled to 200,000 sessions&rdquo; is good. &ldquo;I took a junior dev under my wing and helped her get a promotion&rdquo; is great.</p>

<p>For a senior type position, I&rsquo;m only going to look about 5 years back on job history or so. The industry changes so quickly, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that you were a <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> expert if we&rsquo;re jumping into <a href="http://vuejs.org">Vue</a>. You should still include it for history&rsquo;s sake, but it should be short.</p>

<p>For the juniors and entry-level folks, don&rsquo;t include non-relevant part-time jobs. It&rsquo;s cool that you worked at Chili&rsquo;s for 9 months, but putting noise like that on a resumé makes me grumpy. <strong>Note:</strong> If you worked crap jobs to put yourself through school and are proud of that, and you should be, put it in the cover letter.</p>

<p>If you are changing careers, definitely include that, and make it apparent. Last year I hired someone who got her PhD in physics and after 20 years of that decided to become a developer. She was clearly smart and has been a great addition to the team.</p>

<p>So, if you do all of that, you&rsquo;ll very likely make it to a phone screen interview. That&rsquo;s a whole other post though. But, what about bigger companies? The ones with giant HR departments that have other people phone screen?</p>

<p>In that scenario, your resumé will very likely be screened by a non-technical person. Someone who may not know that if you can build APIs with <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express</a>, you can do it with <a href="https://hapijs.com">Hapi</a>, and is looking for that magic buzzword and will reject you if it is not there. If you feel like you&rsquo;re applying to a company like that (and if they have more than a few hundred employees, you probably are), take special care that your resumé has all of the right bullet points and that they are obvious.</p>

We started with a little capture-the-flag, but that was still a little dicey, certain members of the family would either really want a particular stuffed animal to be the flag, while others definitely didn&rsquo;t want that one to be the flag ever ever ever ever.</p>

<p>I was familiar with a simple game mechanic of capture points. Each team flips over a card-type thing to their color and they get points for that. The more capture points the better — it keeps everyone moving. If you get shot, you have to go back to your re-spawn point and start over. The catch was that keeping score was too tricky without some kind of impartial observer.</p>

<p>Being the coder that I am I whipped up something quickly for iOS and called it Red/Blue, for the two teams it had. It&rsquo;s a basic premise:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the app launches, choose how many minutes to play and tap Start.</li>
<li>The game starts and displays a split screen with two different colors.</li>
<li>When someone taps a color, ex. Red, a clock associated with Red starts to increment.</li>
<li>When Blue is tapped, Red is paused, and Blue increments. I added some sound effects to denote when this happens. (it&rsquo;s just my voice saying &ldquo;Red&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blue&rdquo;. My kids think this is hilarious.)</li>
<li>When the main clock counts down to 0, the game is over and whichever color got incremented the most wins.</li>
</ul>

<p>This worked pretty well. We ended up pulling out old iPhones and iPads and laying them on flat surfaces and threatening all kinds of trouble if one of the kids moved or picked up a device. Ultimately we had four control points which led to all kinds of mayhem.</p>

<p>One thing we noticed was that it was annoying to start a round with the four control points we usually played with. Everyone would have to be by a device to manually start off each timer. A quick googling revealed that <a href="https://www.ralfebert.de/tutorials/ios-swift-multipeer-connectivity/">Multipeer Connectivity is pretty easy to pull off</a>. Another hour of coding and now all of the devices will start off when the first device hits start.</p>

<p>I do not plan to submit this to the app store. I just don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with it. The code is under an MIT license, so that you can do whatever you&rsquo;d like with it.</p>

<p><strong>To install</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> and an iOS device running iOS 10 or higher.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swilliams/redblue">Clone or download the code from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Open the <code>RedBlue.xcodeproj</code> file in Xcode.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust the Signing stuff to get it to run on your own devices.</li>
<li>Connect your device to your Mac.</li>
<li>From the Product menu, select Run.</li>
<li>Xcode will build the app and then install it on your device.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are no tests. I should probably fix that. We&rsquo;ll see.</li>
<li>Once a round starts there&rsquo;s no way to end it prematurely other than force-quitting the app. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a big deal.</li>
<li>The code could stand to be refactored a bit. I only spent a few hours on it so it&rsquo;s a little haphazard. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=patches%20are%20welcome">Patches are welcome</a> ;).</li>
</ul>


<h3>In the future!</h3>

<p>I may add other gameplay modes. Some sort of King of the Hill mode may be interesting, or chained control points (point 2 isn&rsquo;t enabled until point 1 is captured), or any number of other things, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever get to that.</p>

		<p>Let me tell you about &ldquo;Jake&rdquo;. Jake was a colleague of mine and he <em>loved</em> to watch TED talks. If you had lunch with him, you were guaranteed to have a stimulating discussion of the blockchain, or AI, or AR &amp; VR, or some other topic. You&rsquo;d walk away from it with ideas blasting out of your brain. He had that much sincere passion about all the things that others may have passed over as fads.</p>

<p>Jake and I used to to get into it because I tended to be more focused on the present and tended to get annoyed with some of the &ldquo;everything will be better in the future because of [insert-hot-technology]&rdquo; talk. I do believe that change doesn’t happen through technology alone, but tech can facilitate faster and easier change. Facebook didn’t change the world because it had a neat timeline algorithm but it sure did make it easier for millions of people to bump into each other, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>Everybody needs to dream a little. The yearning for something new and better is powerful, and can cause all sorts of ideas to hatch. But there is such a thing as too much dreaming. It’s easy to fall in love with tech. It can be <strong>fun</strong> to imagine what it’ll be like when your house responds intelligently to a wave of your hand. But imagining never brought about anything if work didn’t go with it.</p>

<p>On occasion I&rsquo;ve been called too pragmatic. I tend to focus on honest to goodness tangible products. I get all kinds of itchy when I hear that someone is an &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; or &ldquo;thought leader&rdquo; on something like cryptocurrencies. Usually they have both of those titles on their LinkedIn profiles. Because there seems to be a lot of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/all_hat_and_no_cattle">hat and no cattle</a> surrounding those hot topics, I tend to roll my eyes a bit and go back to focusing on what&rsquo;s in front of me.</p>

<p>This means I have a tendency to be a little behind the curve when something new comes along that I would actually benefit. I&rsquo;m more of a &ldquo;doer&rdquo; than a &ldquo;dreamer&rdquo;. But, then I have to play catch-up. I hate playing catch-up. This isn&rsquo;t scientific but it feels like there is a spectrum here. Some people have their heads totally in the clouds and never get anything done. Some are so focused on the work that they are constantly missing the next big thing.</p>

<p>The ones who are really dangerous are those who have equal parts dreamer and equal parts doer. One of Alan Kay&rsquo;s maxims at Xerox PARC was <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">“The best way to predict the future is to invent it.”</a> Those who can see the trends and how to build businesses and products around them are in the best position to truly bring about change.</p>

<p>I do think that it is possible to move along that spectrum to an extent. In my job, I’ve been working on dreaming a little more. I should be taking a closer look at some of the things I’ve dismissed because while they may be a little far away from reality right now, they may not be in a year or two, and I don’t want to be on my heels if there’s a big enough shift in the market. I love building cool stuff and goshdarnit, if the blockchain really, truly becomes A Thing, then I want to be there for it.</p>

		<p>I tend to function better when I have specific goals. As part of improving my overall health I started to take up running back in mid 2015, and got a little more serious in the early parts of 2016. In a fit of pique I decided to sign up to run the 2017 Rock and Roll Marathon in Phoenix. I&rsquo;d never come close to running 13 miles before, so the prospect scared me a little bit.</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong></p>

<p>So, I started to actually train, even though it was months and months away. I stumbled upon Hal Higdon&rsquo;s training programs, liked what I saw and started to do a mix of the <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51131/Half-Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program">Novice 1</a> and <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51312/Half-Marathon-Novice-2-Training-Program">2</a> programs.</p>

<p>I was averaging about 15 miles per week running before summer hit. Then temperatures were averaging mid 90&rsquo;s even at 5am. It wasn&rsquo;t even a particularly dry heat this go around with the occasional 50% humidity. My mileage tapered off to below 10 per week, but the race was in January, so I knew I could pick it back up again.</p>

<p>As fall wore on temperatures finally dipped back down below furnace levels and I started going on longer runs. I was ahead of the training schedule and decided to give the full 13.1 miles a shot on December 17, and got a time of 2:18:19. Not bad. I originally had goals of running it under 2 hours, but I realized that I was just not that fast, and was ok with it.</p>

<p>One other big training run was on the <a href="https://hikearizona.com/decoder.php?ZTN=737">Charles M. Christiansen trail</a>, a 10.7 hiking trail with some relatively steep spots. A couple spots on the trail weren&rsquo;t very well marked, so it ended up being 11.5 miles&hellip; I don&rsquo;t do a ton of trail running, so that was a fun little experience.</p>

<p><strong>The Race</strong></p>

<p>Eventually January 15, 2017 rolled around. The morning of, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to have for breakfast. I usually eat some mix of breakfast sausage and eggs for protein, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like the right choice to have that grease rolling around in my stomach. I ended up going to my <a href="http://www.chompies.com/bakery-and-bagels">favorite bagel shop</a> and getting a bagel, cream cheese, and lox. It was delicious.</p>

<p>In Tempe, I found some parking<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, stood in line for 20 minutes to use the bathroom, and made it to my corral as the first starters got going. When I registered, I&rsquo;d estimated my finishing time to be 2:20, which placed me right in the middle of the pack.</p>

<p>Eventually we were off! I knew pacing was important and tried to keep a stable one despite the nerves and all the people. I found myself passing a lot of other racers at the start. I checked my watch a few times and my heart rate was fine, so I kept it up.</p>

<p>My goal going in was to be a little faster than my December run. I was aiming for 2:15. A few miles in I saw a the 2:15 pacer. She was easy to spot because she was holding a tall sign with &ldquo;2:15&rdquo; on it. My pace put me ahead of her and I found myself passing more people.</p>

<p>I was feeling good and enjoying the weather. Rain had been predicted, but never materialized, for which I was grateful. Temperature was about 50 degrees with 70% humidity. I was sweating a bit, but not too badly. I started to keep an eye open for the 2:10 pacer.</p>

<p>I kept up my pace and was still passing people and eventually hit the halfway mark. I had been listening to a podcast and decided to switch it over to my running playlist. <a href="https://raceroster.com/events/2017/10542/the-wicked-marathonhalf-marathon4-mile-and-the-spooky-kids-sprint">Let it Out</a> by Switchfoot kicked in and I felt energized. My pace crept up a bit, but I was still feeling pretty good.</p>

<p>The race had water and/or gatorade stations every mile or so I didn&rsquo;t bring an additional bottle. Grabbing a cup of water while jogging and drinking it is tricky, but I got it to work.</p>

<p>The course also had a number of portapotties on the course, should you need that. I tend to hyrdate a lot and need to pee on long runs. The portapotties all had decently sized lines at the first few miles, and thinned out in the latter ones. Around mile 8 I decided to use one, thinking it was available. But, it was locked and in use. I jogged around a bit not wanting to get cold. It felt like hours were ticking by while I waited. In reality it was probably only 30 seconds, but I grew impatient and got back in the race.</p>

<p>Food is also a factor for my long runs. I usually bring a granola bar with me and eat it piece by piece after 8 miles. It&rsquo;s a good 240 calorie boost after burning 800. I had one in my pocket, but never even reached for it. I&rsquo;ve always believed that bagels have magical powers and this proved it because I wasn&rsquo;t even a bit hungry at all during the whole race.</p>

<p>At mile 9 was The Hill. I&rsquo;d heard about it from people who had run the course in the past and how hard The Hill was. I got to it and saw that a lot of people were slowing down. By a lot.</p>

<p>The Hill was not that steep. Come on people.</p>

<p>Total elevation change on the race is 155ish feet, with this hill making up a big part of it, which is practially nothing. My training on the long trail was significantly harder to run. I kept my pace a cruised up, again passing a lot of people. The &lsquo;fun&rsquo; part of the course is that you turn around just past the top of the hill and go right back down. At the top there was a pretty awesome drum and percussion band going to town. That plus a little downhill were when I started to go faster. I passed quite a few people going down. Had it been longer or steeper I would&rsquo;ve had to slow down, but my quads were doing well and the footing was fine.</p>

<p>I did start to get a little tired in mile 11. I was ready to be done with the race by that point. I think the humidity was sapping me by then. I grabbed a cup of water and downed it and kept moving.</p>

<p>This whole time I never saw the 2:10 pacer. I was a little bummed that I couldn&rsquo;t even see him/her, but assumed they were just around the next corner and I wasn&rsquo;t that far behind.</p>

<p>Mile 12 hit and I was re-energized again. One more mile to go! I checked my watch and it was right around 1:53. Holy crap. Under 2 hours was still out, but I realized I could blow past that goal of 2:15. The 2:10 pacer must&rsquo;ve not been holding a sign or I just missed it. I turned up the juice and ran hard.</p>

<p>The last half mile is over a bridge and I was passing people left and right. I wanted start shouting &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost over, why aren&rsquo;t you running?&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t. I got around the last corner and saw my wife, kids, and mother cheering me on, which was great. I jumped on the last timing mat and started to make my way through the mass of finishers. The funny thing about the finishing area was that it was filled with all the sponsors handing out chocolate milk, sports drinks, bananas, etc. If I ate/drank all the stuff there I would&rsquo;ve easily thrown up.</p>

<p>I found out later that that my official time was 2:02:57, which was far faster than I was expecting to run.</p>

<p><strong>After/Next</strong></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t particularly tired or sore after the race. However, the stiffness and soreness did set after sitting in the car for the 30 minute drive home. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad though.</p>

<p>Knowing myself, sometimes when I hit a goal I fall back into bad habits. I don&rsquo;t want that to happen this time. So, <a href="https://raceroster.com/events/2017/10542/the-wicked-marathonhalf-marathon4-mile-and-the-spooky-kids-sprint">I signed up to run a <em>full</em> marathon in October</a>. 26 miles to run seems insane, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to train properly and see how it goes.</p>

		<p>OAuth is, to borrow a phrase, a bag of hurt. Not just any bag, but the kind that is thrown over your head right before you&rsquo;re thrown into a van and driven down to Tijuana and ransomed for $50,000. I don&rsquo;t like OAuth.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though you need to use it. I&rsquo;m working on an internal tool at <a href="http://tallwave.com">work</a> and want to make sure that only co-workers can use it. I could do the username/password thing, but the world has enough of those. We use Google docs for the office, so everyone has a Google account that could, theoretically, be used to sign in. Thus, OAuth.</p>

<p>The tool itself is a web app that uses <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> on the front-end and <a href="http://hapijs.com/">Hapi</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> as the API and database. It&rsquo;s my first time using Hapi, and I like it quite a bit, seems like a really good tool for API building.</p>

<p>Since this is a completely separate client and server, it adds a bit of a wrinkle to the OAuth dance. There are plenty of &ldquo;Sign in with X&rdquo; libraries out there, but they mostly seem to be written with the intent that the user will only be interacting with that service. In other words, if I was building a Google Docs client app, my life would be easier, but no, I am only authenticating a user&rsquo;s account and then treating that as the key to my own system&hellip; which makes it more manual. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that Google&rsquo;s OAuth documentation is lousy. There are many different ways to authenticate, and <a href="https://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client">libraries</a> to support the different ways, and they&rsquo;ve changed over time, so searching for help is difficult.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client (Ember) &ldquo;signs in with Google&rdquo;. If this is successful it receives an <code>authorizationCode</code>. This code by itself is useless, it just means the user signed in ok.</li>
<li>The server (Hapi) needs to validate this code and turn it into an <code>accessToken</code>.</li>
<li>If <em>that</em> is successful, we can query the Google API (from the server still) for the account information, verify that they are from Tallwave, and then send credentials back down to the client.</li>
<li>The client receives the credentials, stores them locally, and includes them for subsequent API requests.</li>
</ol>


<p>Errors need to be handled at all the steps along the way too.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 — Client Side</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Vestorly/torii">Torii</a> is a pretty good (though a wee bit out of date) library for Ember that handles a good amount of the Google sign in process. Follow its installation instructions and setup the configuration and the proper adapter. Here&rsquo;s my <code>environment.js</code> entry:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/oauth#authorization-scopes"><code>scope</code></a> property is important. That allows you to query for the user&rsquo;s account later on. The only other point with Torii worth mentioning is how I sent the authorization code to my API. The <code>open</code> method on the <code>torii-adapters/application.js</code> is called after Google auth finishes, and that is where you create the &ldquo;session&rdquo; for authentication.</p>

<p>By default Ember uses the JSON API for the API layer, and I tend to go with the flow. But in this case, since we&rsquo;re sending a single value to the server and will throw it away immediately after&hellip; Setting up a model seems overkill for that. We can drop down to regular old jQuery for this.</p>

<p>Worth pointing out is that we are expecting our API to return some JSON that will be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stored locally (<code>sessionStore</code> is a <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.7.0/applications/services/">service</a>, which we&rsquo;ll define later), and will be retrieved later.</li>
<li>Returning the <code>currentUser</code> object will merge it into the underlying session, so that it can be retrieved in routes, components, templates etc. This isn&rsquo;t permanent storage though, if the user refreshes the page, it&rsquo;ll be gone, hence <code>sessionStore</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Step 2 — On the Server</strong></p>

<p>This is where the fun begins. If you&rsquo;re playing at home, I used Node 5 and Hapi 13.x.x. First, you&rsquo;ll need to get your credentials from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>. I&rsquo;m not going to walk through those steps, but you&rsquo;ll need an OAuth client ID for a Web Application. Specifically, you&rsquo;ll need the client id, client secret, and redirect URL (yes, even though you won&rsquo;t be redirecting to anything at this point).</p>

<p>Then, install the <code>googleapis</code> dependency.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, let&rsquo;s build a service that sends Google an <code>authorizationCode</code> and gets an accessToken back. You&rsquo;ll call this service from your route handler.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a mouthful and could definitely stand a good refactoring, but it goes through the steps needed to get some information from Google. You can see more <a href="http://google.github.io/google-api-nodejs-client/12.4.0/index.html">APIs</a> you can call, but the documentation on a lot of them is rather sparse. For example, adding the <code>oauthClient</code> to <code>params</code> is not apparent, but necessary for each call.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now determined if the user should actually have access to what they just signed in to and sent the response back to the client. That&rsquo;s pretty good! Refresh your beverage, take a deep breath and then let&rsquo;s get handle that response and get our client in order to keep moving.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 — Back on the Client</strong></p>

<p>You might have noticed again that we did not send the session information back in JSON API format either. This was intentional since we aren&rsquo;t going to be storing this in the standard Ember store, and therefore don&rsquo;t need the additional benefit of using something that standardized. You could if you wanted to, but for this occasion, I did not want to set up a model (or in this case model<em>s</em> to support the nested structure).</p>

<p>Back up in our <code>Ember.RSVP.Promise</code> handler there was this line:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// In torii-adapters/application.js</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;sessionStore&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">save</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">account</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once you receive a response, you&rsquo;ll need to store it. You could use Ember Data, but that felt overkill to me; I needed to access the tokens within the response for subsequent API calls, and nothing else. I ended up building an <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.8.0/applications/services/">Ember service</a> that serialized the content and stored it in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>. You can go your own way too.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 — Making authenticated requests</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re authorized (or have displayed a fancy error message) and are ready to make actual requests to get actual data. I like to authenticate my API requests by including my authorization token in the <code>Authorization</code> header on requests. Ember allows for this by overriding the <code>headers</code> computed property in your Adapter:</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 — Verify authentication on the server</strong></p>

<p>There are may ways to <a href="http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth">authenticate requests with Hapi</a>. Hapi calls these &ldquo;Schemes&rdquo;. A Scheme is made up of multiple Strategies but since we only have one, we&rsquo;ll just refer to it as a Scheme.</p>

<p>You define a Scheme as a function that takes a <code>server</code> and some <code>options</code> as arguments and go from there. Here&rsquo;s <code>api-auth.js</code>:</p>

<p>Or use the boolean <code>false</code> to skip auth altogether for a route, such as your session creation API.</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re done! You now have an authenticated API. There are plenty of other points that could be expanded on, but it&rsquo;s getting a little long in the tooth now.</p>

<p><strong>Wait, why not use Bell?</strong></p>

<p>The Hapi organization maintains a project called <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/bell">Bell</a> that is a &ldquo;Third-party login plugin for hapi&rdquo;, including OAuth services. It&rsquo;s great, but the catch is that since half of our authentication takes place in the browser, we can&rsquo;t quite use it the way it is intended to be used.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Maine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; do you have family or friends out there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s usually how the conversation went when I informed people of The Williams Family 2016 Vacation plans. It was kind of weird. I mean Maine&rsquo;s not exactly the hotspot for getaways. There are a bunch of more tropical places. Hawaii, Florida, The Caribbean, Idaho. What&rsquo;re you gonna do in Maine? Visit Stephen King?</p>

<p>Well, here&rsquo;s what we did.</p>

<h1>Beach time</h1>

<p>We rented a place for the week in Old Orchard Beach. It was a nice little beach condo about 100 feet from the ocean. You wouldn&rsquo;t normally think of Maine as being a beach destination, but it was better than a lot of quite of few of the beaches in southern California I&rsquo;ve been to. Not too rocky, no giant riptide, water was warm enough (mostly). The waves weren&rsquo;t quite as nice, but fine enough to swim through and throw small children into.</p>

<h1>Weather</h1>

<p>The temperature was usually in the low 80&rsquo;s during the day. The last day was warm, topping 90, which apparently didn&rsquo;t happen at all last year. Other than that, it was great. It rained a few of the days, but that was a nice change of pace.</p>

<h1>Food</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m on record as loving seafood. If it lives in the ocean I&rsquo;ll probably like eating it, and lots of things swim in the ocean near Maine. We had lobster, lobster rolls, lobster mac &lsquo;n cheese, crab rolls, crab cakes, and shrimp. Most of it was ridiculously cheap. The best places were little dive type places that smelled of delicious fish. I didn&rsquo;t take too many pictures because I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of taking pictures of food. Perhaps my favorite was a lunch that consisted of two full lobsters, a lobster roll, and a shrimp cocktail. All of that was under $40, which is usually the price for a single lobster at a fancy restaurant out here. Not bad.</p>

<h1>Nature</h1>

<p>Maine&rsquo;s one of the most beautiful places on Earth. The beaches are just a few miles from some amazing forests. I could gush, but I&rsquo;ll let the pictures sell it some more.</p>

<h1>And the rest</h1>

<p>Maine also has Lighthouses. This one is called the Portland Head Light.</p>

<p>We visited a farm and picked berries. Then ate them.</p>

<p>We rented kayaks and paddled up the Saco river.</p>

<h1>And Finally</h1>

<p>We had an early checkout time on Saturday, but our flight back wasn&rsquo;t until the evening. We took the scenic route through New Hampshire and stopped at Cathedral Ledge for a little hiking and sightseeing. It was a good stop.</p>
