I love my technological toys, and I love getting new ones even more. The role of the phone itself has evolved into something much more important in my life. It is probably the second most used piece of electronics I own, just behind my computer, so it needs to be a good one.

<p>Since I have been working in Dallas for the last few months, I have been eating at quite a few restaurants. Thus, I have become very familiar with the after-meal mint. Not all mints are created equal; there are some that are simply better than others. As a service to you, I have ranked them in ascending order:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>First, there are the hard-peppermint-candy-cane mints. These are the most common, and while they are a little better than having your breath smell like chimichangas, they aren&#8217;t memorable. Some places have the ones that are green and brown, which provide a slightly better experience, but still aren&#8217;t worth writing home about.</li>
<li>Slightly better than those guys are the fruity cylindrical mints (for lack of a better name). I will usually grab a couple of these and mix flavors. My favorites are blue and red, though I usually tire of sucking on them after a little while.</li>
<li>Next, are what I believe are called &#8220;pillow&#8221; mints, because they look like pillows. In my experience, I have found these most often at Chick-fil-a&#8217;s. They are tasty, and remind me a little like chewable Tylenols from when I was kid<sup>1</sup>. The only downside is that after eating them, they turn into a sticky paste that binds to my teeth for the next ten minutes.</li>
<li>Finally, we come to the king. Andes mints. If a server brings a few of these guys to the table along with the check, he automatically qualifies for a nice tip. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that the waiter spilled the clam chowder all over your dress, honey, but he brought Andes mints; that&#8217;s gotta be at least 15%.&#8221; One time I was leaving a place and passed the server station. There was an open and unguarded box of Andes mints sitting right there. Let&#8217;s just say I had to spend a little extra time in the gym the following day and leave it at that.</li>
</ul>
<div>These are the things that I feel I should share about my travels.</div>
<div><span>1. I may or may not have faked headaches when I was a kid to eat more chewable Tylenols. I liked the flavor. I have no regrets.</span></div>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> <i>Disclaimer: I have not worked as a full time software tester, so this point of view is from a developer who would love to see the following qualities in QA personnel that I work with.</i>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<div> Sometime early in my career as a software developer, I learned that my code was not perfect and needed testing before being released<span>1</span>. Since then I have worked with a couple of good testers, and unfortunately, some truly terrible ones as well. I would very much prefer to work with the good ones, so I thought I would list some characteristics that could help a would-be tester become a great one. </div> <p></p>
<div>
<b><span>This is the biggest: </span>Your goal is not a checklist</b>. This one is partially attributable to poor management. Testers who are graded on the number of bugs they find tend to try to file as many as they can. Your goal is actually <i>not</i> to find a ton of bugs; <b>your goal is to release the highest quality software possible</b>. I can forgive many testing sins if just this one maxim is embraced.</div> <p></p>
<div>
<b>Understand the application</b>. I am always shocked to read a bug report that is completely at odds with what is written in the application&#8217;s requirements. &#8220;The app is <i>supposed</i> to work that way,&#8221; is far too often the answer. One way to mitigate this is to include testers in the design of the product they will be testing. This includes knowing which developer/department to assign the bugs. In most cases the poor UI guys have 95% of the bugs assigned to them and end up serving as triage for the rest of the group. A good tester knows that even though an error dialog is popping up in the UI, it may very well be because of a problem with the database.</div> <p></p>
<div>
<b>Know your tools</b>. If you are testing a web app, you had better have tons of extensions for debugging, header analysis, and browser tweaking installed. You need to know how to take a good screenshot and highlight the problematic area. This goes hand in hand with &#8220;Record important information&#8221; in a few paragraphs. Good tools make it easier to specify what the problem is. Taking a screenshot of your entire desktop and pasting it into Word is always a bad idea.<span>2 </span>Knowing the bug tracker inside and out is mandatory.</div> <p></p>
<div>
<b>Leave your ego at the door</b>. This goes for both testers and developers. There is naturally an adversarial relationship between both tribes; one group exists to find problems with the others&#8217; work, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be ugly. I once worked with a guy who hated every single QA person he met because his ego would not let him accept that his code had bugs. Conversely, you are not King of the World for finding an obvious defect that the programmer should have caught.</div> <p></p>
<div>
<b>Record important information</b>. Taking a screenshot of an exception screen is a little better than writing &#8220;it dun broke&#8221; in the description field, but not by much. Does this exception happen every time? With different information? In different browsers? Are there any unique or special rules applied to this specific instance? </div> <p></p>
<div>I once worked on a product that needed different rules applied to different customers&#8217; accounts. These rules caused a bunch of validation issues and various one-off bugs that couldn&#8217;t be reproduced in the development environment (since the rules were different for development and production). It was beyond frustrating to get bug reports that lacked any bit of helpful information to track these nasty issues down, and resulted in many cannot-reproduce/close/re-open wars.</div> <p></p>
<div>Be specific too! I recently received a bug report that said that the UI I created was different from the wireframe provided by the designer. It included a screenshot of my UI and one of the wireframe. I would have had to play the <a href="http://www.spotthedifference.com/" target="_blank">spot-how-many-differences game</a>. Instead, a good bug would have been to list what was wrong.</div> <p></p>
<div>
<b>You don&#8217;t need to know how to program</b>. Though a little bit of knowledge helps. Knowing what an Exception is and how one shows up would be beyond helpful. Knowing how they are thrown in the app you are testing would be even better.</div> <p></p>
<div>Just the other day, I ran into an issue where an Exception was being thrown, but was actually masking the real problem. The Exception stated that there was a problem with the AuthenticationService I was using. I spent a few minutes trying to figure out what happened since nobody had recently worked on that particular service. We soon realized that the service itself was fine; the problem was actually in the config file shared by <i>all</i> services. The AuthenticationService was just the first one called, so it bombed first. Having a solid knowledge of how an Exception works and why the application is throwing them would avoid red herring problems like this.</div> <p></p>
<div>This list is by no means exhaustive, but I do feel that if more developers were working with more testers that had those qualities, software in general would be much better.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p> <p></p>
<div><span>1. That would have been somewhere between 10 minutes and an hour of writing my first bit of code.</span></div>
<p></p>
<div> <span>2. Why is this so awful? First, any decent bug tracker will automatically make images easy to browse through and view; hiding it in a Word doc prevents that. Second pasting a screen capture will automatically save it as an uncompressed bitmap and result in a large file size. Even over a corporate intranet, it would still take far too long to download and extract. Seriously, friends don&#8217;t let friends use a take poor screenshots.</span>

<div>Apple just announced their newest super gizmo, the <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad</a>. Like the iPhone, iPod, and pretty much every other mobile device, it does not have a front facing video camera to allow video chat. Of course, a certain subset of people really wish it did, and continually whine about said lack. But do you know why it doesn&#8217;t have video chat?</div> <p></p>
<div><i>Because video chat on a mobile device just doesn&#8217;t work.</i></div>
<p></p>
<div>Here&#8217;s how I know: Take your phone. Now, hold it out in front of you in a position that you think would be fitting for a video chat. Keep holding it there, and be steady; no shaking. Keep holding. Try it for just 30 seconds. Is your arm tired yet?</div> <p></p>
<div>There simply is no way to comfortably hold something like a phone out in front of you without support. You could hold it lower and try to support your arm with your body at the elbow (like a normal phone), but then your chat buddy will get a good look at what is currently up your nose.</div> <p></p>
<div>The iPad could work with a stand/dock, but in that situation, it&#8217;s not really <i>mobile</i> is it?</div>

		<div><div><div><div><div>There&#8217;s a very nice sushi place here in Dallas called <a href="http://www.sushi-sake.com/">Sushi Sake</a>. We went there last night, and I ordered the Aji sashimi (it&#8217;s actually a Mackerel, but I just like the title). It came with the body of the fish artfully arranged with the sashimi. The sashimi itself was quite good, however when I was done, the waitress came by, took the plate, and said she was going to &#8220;fry it up&#8221; for me. I wasn&#8217;t paying that much attention so I just nodded.<p></p>
<div>After she disappeared to the kitchen I actually processed what she said. Fry up the fish&#8230; <i>head</i>? And fins? And tail? Hmmm. Eventually she brought it back, and yes, what was left was definitely deep fried. I girded up my loins and actually ate most of it. Apparently the Aji has soft bones, because I was able to just chomp right on through. That last sentence might be a little squeamish for some folks.</div> <p></p>
<div>I didn&#8217;t eat the head (or eyeball) though&#8230; as Shawn said, you have to draw the line somewhere.</div> <p></p>

<p>I figure I should probably talk a little bit about the cruise we recently went on, since it was our first real vacation in a while, and will probably be for another while.</p>
<p></p>
<div>We went on a Cruise from January 4th through the 8th down from Mission Beach to Catalina to Ensenada. I like cruises because everything is pretty much taken care of for you. </div>
<p></p>
<div>During the trip, <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/PacificCruise/content/DSC_4073_large.html">Rachel saw the ocean for the first time</a>, though I don&#8217;t think she quite understood it. After a little prodding, she took to <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/PacificCruise/content/DSC_4164_large.html">walking on sand</a>, and really liked the shoreline. We had to keep her from running in more than <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/PacificCruise/content/DSC_4236_large.html">once</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The food on the boat was pretty decent, though I think our best meal was back in Mission Beach at a restaurant called <a href="http://www.worldfamous.signonsandiego.com/">&#8220;World Famous&#8221;</a>. I had a ridiculously good <a href="http://www.worldfamous.signonsandiego.com/menu.html" title="Potato Wrapped White Sea Bass">sea bass</a> wrapped in some thing potato slices and some sort of shrimp/crab cake like thing to go with it. Very tasty. On the boat, the dessert was probably the best. They had a chocolate molten cake that was a chocolate lover&#8217;s dream. Erica had it every night.</div>
<p></p>
<div>One particular evening, we were heading down to dinner and saw another couple get into an opposing elevator. When the doors shut, Erica commented how the lady was wearing gigantic heels and that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to walk in those. Both elevator doors opened at the same time, and as if on cue, the woman took a step, her heel caught, and she went tumbling, throwing her martini glass down and shattering it into pieces right in front of us.</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/PacificCruise/content/DSC_4372_large.html">Rachel</a> developed a new game, called &#8220;Run Around&#8221;. We would take her to an empty deck and told her that she could indeed, &#8220;run around&#8221;. She took it a literally, and held on to a hand and would run in circles around Mommy or Daddy, while yelling &#8220;Run around! Run around!&#8221; </div>
<p></p>
<div>Taking a 2 year old on a cruise was a bit of work, but didn&#8217;t have any big issues. We got a big enough room, that we could unfold a pack-and-play next to the bed, and if we covered the sides with towels, Rachel would go to sleep pretty easily.</div>
<p></p>
<div>In <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/PacificCruise/content/DSC_4671_large.html">Ensenada</a>, I was offered quite a few opportunities buy Viagra, though I passed them up.</div>

For example, I have a variety of home screens set up on my phone&#8230; but I also downloaded&#8230; a Star Trek soundboard, so now whenever I get it a text Worf says &#8216;Captain, incoming message.&#8217; &#8221;</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>Yeah, I&#8217;m going to count that as a con.</div>
