Well, I&#8217;m off on another new job adventure! I just turned in my resignation to my current employer and will be starting my new role in a couple of weeks with <a href="http://www.sogeti.com">Sogeti</a>. I won&#8217;t go into the sordid details of why I&#8217;m leaving, but will say that the primary reason is that I feel I&#8217;ve reached the limit of where my current employer can take me career-wise.
</p>
<p>
My job will be a kind of blend between the stable world of salary-based pay, and contract-like change of scenery. Sogeti consults for many large clients and sends small teams of developers to either develop solutions or augment existing teams.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#8217;m a little nervous, but also excited. I hope this works out.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<div><div><div><div><div>In the past, I have been rather unkind to open source projects. Some of my criticisms may not have been valid, but one thing that I feel still holds is my beef with the &#8220;user experience.&#8221; I use quotes because that expression sounds an awful lot like marketing-speak, which I try to avoid, but can&#8217;t think of a better term.

What I mean is that it is an all too common trend in open source projects to put forth a titanic effort to code the software, but an abysmal one to make it user friendly and to document it well.

Just recently, I needed to implement some form of complicated logging in an application I was tasked with. Most suggestions on the web pointed to the open source library <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" title="log4net homepage">log4net</a>. Those recommendations did come with a word of warning though that it was a little heady to jump right into. But, since time was of the essence, I threw myself off from the high dive and into the deep-end.

Those guys were right.

Log4net is a very robust and extensible logging framework, and it performs well, but it took me the better part of a day and a half to figure out how have it write to Oracle and properly extend the formatters to my fit my will. The documentation is what we in the industry call &#8220;sparse.&#8221; It provides some very basic examples and then just chucks the API at you and throws you to the wolves.

Contrast that with something like <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="SubVersion homepage">SubVersion</a>. SubVersion may not be the greatest Source Control Provider out there, but it has <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" title="Tortoise">TortoiseSVN</a>. The Tortoise UI makes managing a repository of code brain dead simple; even a non-programmer(!) could do it. Installation is easy: a typical windows installer package that requires the standard amount of clicks to get up and running. The app itself is built right into the Windows shell; just right-click and there you are!

Perhaps most importantly though, the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">documentation</a><a href="#21_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was up to snuff. No, more than that, it was superb! It sounded like a <em>real</em> human being wrote it, not a coder! I actually wanted to read the thing. Additionally I learned a thing or two about code management in general, not just pertaining to SubVersion.

I&#8217;d bet that one of the reasons SubVersion is so popular is because it manages to hold the user&#8217;s hand without treating him like a child. From what I can tell, <a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="Git homepage">git</a> is a pretty powerful competitor to SubVersion, but until it has as nice an interface as Tortoise, it will never see as high of an adoption.

I would argue that the single greatest hurdle that the open source movement still needs to overcome is the notion that their audience is not just the geeky programmers huddled up in their caves. It is a tricky line to walk though, too much hand-holding is just as big of a product killer as too little.
<div> <a></a>1.  This may not be the fairest comparisons, the &#8220;documentation&#8221; for SubVersion was originally published as a real book by O&#8217;Reilly. However, my underlying point about documentation still stands. <a href="#21_1_orig">Â«</a>

		<div><div><div><div><div>I enjoy photography, and I think I&#8217;ve been slowly getting better at it.Â However,Â I have felt like I&#8217;ve just been a rut for the longest time. I do think that part of it is simply laziness brought on by the fact that I don&#8217;t have much motivation to get out of the air conditioning when it&#8217;s 110+ outside.

So, I&#8217;m going to try to suck it up and actually go out to some of the &#8220;sites&#8221; around Phoenix. I&#8217;ll probably be doing this on weekends, and if anyone would care to join me, I&#8217;d love to have you.

I&#8217;ll be visiting:
<ul>
<li>Papago Park, specifically the Hole-in-the-rock. This weekend.</li>
	<li>Desert Botanical Gardens. This is mostly because my brother-in-law is getting married here next year and I will be doing the pictures, so I&#8217;d like to scout out the area.</li>
	<li>The Phoenix Zoo. I was never too fond of zoos when I was a kid, maybe I&#8217;ll like them more now.</li>
	<li>Camelback Mountain.</li>
	<li>Pinnacle Peak. I have a friend who goes out rock climbing here from time to time, I&#8217;d like to catch some of that in action.</li>
	<li>The Superstition Mountains. There are tons of trails all around here, by the time I get around to this, it should be cool enough to get some quality hiking.</li>
	<li>Four Peaks.</li>
	<li>Downtown Phoenix and the Biltmore area, for architectural stuff.</li>
</ul>
At some point I&#8217;d like to take more extended trips up through northern Arizona, and hit various places in the Mogollon Rim, and the various canyons.

Does anyone else have some good ideas for places that lend themselves well to photography?Â </div></div></div></div></div>

There was a bunch of garbage littered around, allowing for some cool things, but as the sun went down the clouds turned this color. Five minutes either way and it wasn&#8217;t nearly as impressive.
