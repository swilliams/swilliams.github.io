		<p>Names are hard, especially for a framework or library. A good name is memorable, and can be a shot in the arm in terms of discoverability. Finding a good name is nebulous, and too often falls into the I&rsquo;ll-know-it-when-I-see-it category. But a <em>bad</em> name is easier to define. The biggest sin of bad names is that they are impossible to find answers when you run into questions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to throw rocks at somebody else&rsquo;s hard work, but I think it&rsquo;s been enough time that I can gently criticize the name of the <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype JavaScript library</a><sup>1</sup>. Why was this a bad name? Well, what do you do when you run into a problem that isn&rsquo;t quickly found in the official documentation? Search for it on Google. Now, the term <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype">&ldquo;prototype&rdquo; is a core part of the JavaScript language</a>, which meant that every single search result for &ldquo;prototype X&rdquo;, &ldquo;JavaScript prototype X&rdquo;, &ldquo;prototype js X&rdquo; or any other combination only referred to dealing with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">prototypal inheritance in JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>You may be the biggest fan of both The Simpsons and Ruby. Don&rsquo;t name your library &ldquo;Homer&rdquo;. Again, what happens if someone runs into a problem when using Homer? They&rsquo;re going to try to search for &ldquo;homer fix json serialization&rdquo; and get a bunch of funnier Simpsons quotes. Your JSON parsing library is never going to be more popular than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khSIYmTzt6U">Mr. Simpson</a>, so please, pick something else.</p>

<p>Common words aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a>, and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> are all fairly common English words, but none of them are common enough to pollute search results. Spend a few minutes searching around before putting together your splash page.</p>

1. In the war between Prototype and jQuery, I was in the former&rsquo;s camp for a long time. Prototype seemed like magic back in 2006 when I was coding AJAX manually. Searching for jQuery issues was never a problem though.

		<p>Developers tend to plow through the path of least resistance. Any amount of friction they encounter tends to be routed over or around. For example, I&rsquo;ve worked at a place where Sharepoint was the mandated document storage for the company. The problem is that Sharepoint is awful and unless it was setup by experts, difficult to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.<sup>1</sup> Since it was so convoluted, developers ignored it.</p>

<p>This lead to bigger problems. A sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition">oral tradition</a> was inadvertently created and persisted. Since developers were ignoring documentation, requirements were missed and features were implemented incorrectly. Fingers were pointed and words were exchanged.</p>

<p>Now, imagine for a moment you were the manager in charge of this lot and suddenly found out that your document system was completely ignored by everyone on your team. Bad managers try to correct this with the heavy-handed approach and enforce the IT policy. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen and it isn&rsquo;t pretty. It usually results in the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166626/divine-right-of-kings">Divine Right of Management</a> being invoked, and then rapidly returns to status quo when said manager is not looking.</p>

<p>What should you do instead? Keeping that convoluted game of telephone doesn&rsquo;t work, and erects huge barriers for any new person. <a href="http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Pave_the_Cowpaths">Paving the cowpaths</a> may not necessarily be the best approach either because it could cement bad practices<sup>2</sup>. Anarchy is not a reliable cowpath.</p>

<p>Being a good manager is about removing the friction from your team to enable them to do good work. What&rsquo;s the friction in the above scenario? Dealing with a crummy document management system. How do you remove that? One team I&rsquo;ve worked with used a Github based workflow for source code and started using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis">wikis</a> on Github. Another place used Trello, which required more management, but it was still easy to look stuff up. Heck, you could even have an expert come over and wrestle Sharepoint into being manageable.</p>

<p>Like everything else, there isn&rsquo;t a silver bullet here. In fact, so-called silver bullets tend to create these scenarios (all of the bullet points on the box sure looked good to somebody in a position of authority). A good manager will know their team and understand where these points of friction occur. It might be impossible to smooth them over entirely, but every single bit you can scrape away will only make your team more productive.</p>

1. This shouldn&#8217;t be a Sharepoint gripe fest, but here&#8217;s the process you had to go through to find a document if you didn&#8217;t have a good bookmark. 1) Go to the home page. 2) Click on the &#8220;IT Projects&#8221; &#8220;portal&#8221;. 3) Find the right project in a list on the sidebar. 4) Navigate that project&#8217;s folder hierarchy. Each project&#8217;s hierarchy is completely arbitrary and built by its own madman. 5) Find the document eventually. It&#8217;s a Word doc so, 6) Download the doc. 7) Open it. 8) Edit it. 9) Re-upload it.

I&#8217;ll get back to you in an hour.&#8221;

<p>I bought a new camera a little while ago, and finally had the opportunity to put it through its paces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=2PJ4FLG2K25KQBDP">The Fujifilm X100s</a> isn&rsquo;t particularly cheap, so I saved a while to be able to afford it, but so far I&rsquo;m really liking it.</p>

<p>I have three Nikon DSLRs and an assortment of nice lenses to go with them, so why would I want a smaller, almost Point and Shoot camera? For starters, it&rsquo;s much smaller. I love my Nikons, but carrying around a backpack has never been <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr/">convenient</a>, especially when you need to take a shot fast. It can fit in a large pocket, and I have a belt-style pouch for it too. Its lens is fixed at about the equivalent of 35mm on an SLR. You&rsquo;d think being stuck at a single focal length would be an issue, but it&rsquo;s a good size for when its use cases (informal portraits, walking around, &ldquo;street&rdquo; photography). Oh yeah, and the pictures that come out of it are gorgeous.</p>

<p>Where doesn&rsquo;t it stand up very well? When you need to get closer. When you need the absolute <em>best</em> image quality. When you need a high frame-rate of shots (sports). I wouldn&rsquo;t shoot a wedding with just the X100s, but it would be very useful for wandering around during the reception.</p>

<p>Despite those issues, this is probably my go to camera for 80% of my needs right now. If it had been available 10 years ago when I was considering a DSLR purchase, I might&rsquo;ve gone with this instead.</p>

<time datetime="2014-05-12T13:16:18-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">May 12<span>th</span>, 2014</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;m learning <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> in efforts to stay <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/01/20/keep-your-developer-saw-sharp/">reasonably up to date</a> with client side web technologies. <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/05/06/oh-cool-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer/">This hasn&rsquo;t been the easiest going.</a></p>

<p>Ember&rsquo;s best feature is that it easily binds values in HTML to their corresponding properties on objects. I&rsquo;ve found the implementations of this a little confusing sometimes. Going through the Getting Started guide has been helpful, though <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/displaying-the-number-of-incomplete-todos/">this part tripped</a> me up for a good hour, specifically this snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Within todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That last line turns the associatied method into a <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/">computed property</a>.  My understanding of computed properties was as a means to provide a simple call to complex data (eg. a <code>fullName</code> property that joins <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> properties). This particular method is on a <em>controller</em>, has a previously foreign syntax (<code>@each</code>), and the template that refers to it still uses it&rsquo;s canonical name (<code>remaining</code>).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/assets/ember/zoidberg.gif" alt="Wha?" />
</figure>


<p>In order to understand just what was happening, I pumped the brakes and dug into the sample application. My first question was why they were using a computed property altogether. I whipped up another method and added it to my controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>todos {{derp}}<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This resulted in the method body being substituted in the template, which reminded me that <code>{{derp}}</code> was just printing out whatever <code>derp</code> evaluated to, in this case a function.<sup>1</sup> So I made <code>derp</code> a computed property:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;what&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This worked. My <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was now &lsquo;todos derp!&rsquo;. In fact, you could simplify it even more by doing this: <code>property()</code> and leaving off a name altogether. It also demonstrated that the first argument to <code>property</code> didn&rsquo;t have a bearing on what goes in the Template. Next step was to substitute my static text with something useful.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>And sure enough, the title was now &lsquo;todos 2&rsquo;. I suspected this would work because my controller extended <code>Ember.ArrayController</code>, giving it access to <code>filterBy</code>. This lead me back to one of my original questions: what is the purpose of <code>'@each.isCompleted'</code>?</p>

<p>I played around with the todo app a little more and noticed that my <code>{{derp}}</code> was not automatically updating when todos where checked off while the original <code>{{remaining}}</code> was. Then it hit me: <code>'@each'</code> must be a special directive for an <code>ArrayController</code> that bound that function to the <code>isCompleted</code> property of <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.ArrayController.html#property__each"><em>each</em></a> object in its array. Putting a <code>console.log('called');</code> confirmed this suspicion — it&rsquo;s called every time <code>isCompleted</code> is accessed.</p>

<p>After this bit of forensics, things make a little more sense now. I do wish this association was a little more spelled out in the documentation though for us thick-headed developers.</p>

		<p>Most people who have even heard of it would say that it&rsquo;s a Twitter clone, created out of <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/what-twitter-could-have-been">frustrations over the direction it was heading</a>. Currently, the <a href="http://app.net">home page</a> makes it look like an identity and/or messaging service. Over the last couple years, it&rsquo;s bounced around and offered different services. According to the founders, the <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">genesis</a> of it was to create a backend-as-a-service to enable developers to make the next generation of online applications.</p>

<p>The problem was that I don&rsquo;t think App.net ever moved beyond the shadow of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Twitter clone.&rdquo; App.net&rsquo;s API does offer the capabilities to make some really <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">slick</a> <a href="http://favd.net/">apps</a>, but there hasn&rsquo;t been any one thing that captured everyone&rsquo;s attention to make them say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; There is the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/">microblogging service</a>, the <a href="https://omega.app.net/">messaging service</a>, the <a href="https://broadcast.app.net">broadcast service</a>, the <a href="https://backer.app.net/">crowdfunding service</a> and <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/">the cloud storage service</a>. If you&rsquo;re being unkind, you could call them the Twitter clone, the iMessage clone, the Push Notification clone, the Kickstarter clone, and the Dropbox clone. Each of those services are good, but none of them have differentiated themselves from their biggest competitors. If all of those went dark tomorrow, everybody would be able to move back to what they were using before without too much trouble.</p>

<p>There was a great initial fervor when App.net launched. Some big names supported it both vocally and financially. Unfortunately, their engagement petered out over time. The most damning evidence of this? Out of all the people on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801133202/https://join.app.net/">this page</a> the only person who still interacts on App.net regularly is <a href="https://alpha.app.net/garrytan">Garry Tan</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I was very bullish on App.net, which makes the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/">latest news</a> saddening. It isn&rsquo;t the end yet, but when you have literally no employees working on a service and suspend the biggest <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">incentive to develop on your platform</a>, it isn&rsquo;t too far away. Right now the best case I see for App.net is
that it continues along as is, but with little to no growth. I did renew my paid account this year, but I don&rsquo;t know if the service will be around for another renewal next time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like armchair quarterbacking. Saying what <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/woman-a-leading-authority-on-what-shouldnt-be-in-p,35922/">should have been done</a> is too easy and requires no effort on my part. I do think that a lesson to take away from this is that identity is important and needs to be clear to customers.</p>

<p>And as pointed out by <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chriskrycho/post/29913830">Chris Krycho</a>, it looks like Garry&#8217;s posts are just cross-posted from Twitter using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/6/bio/53">Ed Catmull</a> knows a thing or two about making Great Things. In 2007 he gave a talk at Stanford about how Pixar does their thing. It&rsquo;s almost an hour long but you should watch it.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k2h2lvhzMDc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Some of the things that resonated with me and are just as applicable in other practices:</p>

<p>Present work <em>every day</em>. Even if it is incomplete or sucks. Why? It forces collaboration. If everybody is bumping up against each other, ideas will spread. Problems don&rsquo;t fester either; if someone is struggling on some task for too long it becomes apparent and somebody else can lend a hand if necessary.</p>

<p>Success hides problems. This might be the biggest one. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss problems during times of feast. Catmull also mentioned that they have an open-door policy for everyone and strive to make it safe for <em>everyone</em> to tell the truth. This is hard to do. Even if the CEO&rsquo;s door is open, rank-and-file employees will simply feel <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-hard-could-it-be-how-i-learned-to-love-middle-managers.html?partner=fogcreek">intimidated walking in and stating their mind</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this, Pixar introduced post-morterms; essentially a discussion after the completion of a project to highlight what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. These can be annoying, which means that people will game them, even unintentionally. Pixar found that they had to change up the post-morterms every time in order to get real value from them.</p>

<p>What it boiled down to was that their goal was to create teams of good people that functioned well together. Good people don&rsquo;t tolerate nonsense. If you give a bad idea to a good group, they&rsquo;ll fix it, or throw it away and come up with a better one. A group of mediocre people will take a good idea and screw it up. Therefore, hiring the right people, and then managing them is critical.</p>

<p>Human organziations are inherently unstable and fall over slowly. The fall is slow, but the collapse is quick. The more I experience I get, the more I see people management as a critical role on any project with more than one person. A good project manager constantly takes information from the team and acts on that in order to avoid the fall.</p>

		<p>With news of the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">heartbleed vulnerability</a> I&rsquo;ve taken the <strike>paranoid</strike> precautionary measure of changing all my passwords. I have over 200 logins in my <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a><sup>1</sup> library, so I&rsquo;ve seen just about every kind of password change process imaginable over the last day or two. My conclusion is that there are a lot of <strong>terrible</strong> implementations of this process.</p>

<p>Security conflicts with convenience, and changing passwords is never convenient. But there are ways to at least make it quick. Here&rsquo;s what I expect when I got to a site to change my password:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign in.</li>
<li>Click something like &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Account&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Profile&rsquo;. Ideally, there should only be one of those on the page to avoid guessing.</li>
<li>Have the word &lsquo;password&rsquo; on that Settings page. Be it a button, link, or inline form, just make it easy to find.</li>
<li>If I need to enter my old password first, make it the first field.</li>
<li>Display some kind of notification that my change was successful.</li>
<li>Optionally, send me an email telling me it changed, just in case a bad guy did it.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s not so bad right? This has been the standard way of doing things ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgi-bin">cgi-bin</a> was a thing. But so many websites get it wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, <em>have</em> a Change Password form. More than a couple sites I went to don&rsquo;t have one and rely on you to do the Reset My Password dance. This means I have to sign out, go back to the sign in page, click the reset link, enter my email, wait for the email, open the email, click the link in the email, then finally enter a new password. Shame on you if you make me do this. Shame.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict password length. 1Password let&rsquo;s me create a 50 character password, yet I&rsquo;d say at least 40% of the sites I went to couldn&rsquo;t handle a password that long.</li>
<li>If you have to restrict length for some reason, tell me exactly what that maximum is.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
    <img alt="Password WTF" src="/images/assets/password-wtf.png" />
</figure>


<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict what characters I can use. There is no technical reason I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to use spaces or symbols in a password.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict copy/paste in the password field. Paypal was the only one I saw that did this, and it boggles my mind. A random, complex password is going to be more secure than one I can easily type in (which can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_tables">cracked quickly</a>). Don&rsquo;t actively prevent me from trying to make my financial data secure!</li>
</ul>


<p>Security already has its own set of barriers, and a certain subset of people will never take it seriously. As a web developer, it is entirely up to you to keep that subset from growing in size.</p>
