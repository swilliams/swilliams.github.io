<p>Don&#8217;t save full paths to resources in your iOS app<sup>1</sup>. 
I&#8217;m working on an iPad application, and this just bit me pretty hard.</p>

<p>Your application lives in a directory kind of like this: <code>/blah/blah/blah/Applications/EE8E3EBF-A7A9-4680-81D0-BB5E7DFE859E/Thing.app/</code> That big old string of capital letters and numbers is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guid">GUID</a>, which means that your app is guarenteed to have its own unique folder in the file system. What I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> know was that this will change every time you update the app. This behavior doesn&#8217;t happend during development/debugging.</p>

<p>I was storing the whole path to audio files in a database<sup>2</sup>, so when I released a second beta to my testers, all their clips from the first beta stopped working and caused crashes because the app was looking for files in paths that no longer existed.</p>

<p>The fix was to only store the filename of the audio because the whole path could just be generated at runtime, and then migrating everyone&#8217;s data to the new way (which also was bug prone).</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t ever accuse me of burying the lede.</li>
<li>This would&#8217;ve happened if those values were stored in a plist, xml file, or anywhere.</li>
</ol>

<div><div><p>First up was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/">Pacific Rim</a>. This is the personification of &#8220;summer movie&#8221;. It&#8217;s loud, more than a little ridiculous, and about as subtle as the giant robots that are featured in it. I generally dislike most movies that fit in that genre (e.g. Michael Bay), but this managed to do the things those movies do while having a heart about it. Yes, it requires a bit of disbelief suspension, but it knows that, and uses it to roll you in its tidal wave. I left the theater blown away by what I had just seen and feeling a little bit battered in the process. </p></div></div>
</div></div>
<div>
<div><div><div>
<p>The other was the polar opposite: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3431967744/tt2084989">Upstream Color</a>. No explosions, robots, or any special effects. However, I was also entranced by it. It was made by Shane Carruth, who also made the time-travel-mind-messer-upper Primer. It has gorgeous cinematography and incredible characters. Even if things are a little hard to follow, you can get the gist just by the emotions that the characters exude.</p>

<p>Both movies are spectacles, but in completely different ways. In Pacific Rim, each encounter ratchets the tension up a bit, then let&#8217;s off a little steam. In Upstream Color, you are sucked more and more into the main characters&#8217; lives and see how they cope with their experiences. And at the end of both there is just a great emotional release that hits home. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://youtu.be/8d4-AUwkKAw">YouTube video</a> linked from <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/18/multiplane">Marco Arment</a> (riffing on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/06/multiplane.html">this post by Manton Reece</a>) is awesome. It&#8217;s Walt Disney describing Disney animation&#8217;s Multiplane camera, which was used to provide a much better sense of depth and movement in their feature films. Some points I took away from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much they shared that could be considered a &#8220;trade secret&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know much about the history of animation, and it very could be that this was old news at the time, but you don&#8217;t see too many companies revealing how their technology works in that level of detail.</li>
<li>How educational it was. It&#8217;s just seven and a half minutes long, but you&#8217;ll learn how traditional cell based animation worked, how it limits perspective, and how the &#8220;new&#8221; multiplane camera fixed that.</li>
<li>Walt Disney called them &#8220;cartoons&#8221;. Not &#8220;animations&#8221; or &#8220;films&#8221; or anything else.</li>
<li>The acting from the guys moving the camera is hilarious.</li>

<p>The iOS 7 beta bug had bit me, but I wasn&#8217;t about to install it on my primary iPhone, therein lay madness. I had a bit of cash running around and decided to buy a spare iPod Touch to install the beta.</p>

<p>I went to the Apple store and asked to purchase a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/">32 GB black model</a>. I chatted with the clerk for a bit and told him it was only going to be a development device. He mentioned that the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch_16gb">16 GB version</a> was available too. I had thought that the 16 GB was last year&#8217;s model with the 3.5&#8221; screen still hanging around to hit the $229 price point. He replied that it had been recently updated with the newer tech, just no camera, less RAM, and so on. Since I didn&#8217;t need those for my particular purposes, I just bought that one.</p>

<p>How many other stores would talk a customer out of $70? Contrast this to Best Buy and I&#8217;d be out of an extra $70 and have to deal with a hard sale for a case, warranty, and accessories. This is why Apple retail  can&#8217;t be underestimated.</p>

<p>The job market is red hot for software developers right now. Last time I was looking for a job, I made the mistake of putting my resume on CareerBuilder. I ended up having to fend recruiters off with a <a href="/words/havent-heard-back-yet">pointy stick</a>. The problem was that 100% of the jobs they were throwing at me were awful. I ended up going with a reference from a prior colleague.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get a job, but I want a place that I can stay at long term. I&#8217;m not necessarily looking for an employer that has all sorts of &#8220;perks&#8221; either. Ping-pong, video games, masseuses, free food, and go-karts are neat and all, but feel a bit like coddling to me. It tends to hide the teeth used to induce all kinds of ills too.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to feel valued. Value means that what I do makes a difference, and isn&#8217;t just there to fill a time sheet. Not everything is going to send people to the moon, I get that, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be the icy grip of death either.</p>

<p>How would an employer show that they value me? Know <em>how</em> I&#8217;m doing, and not just <em>what</em> I&#8217;m doing. Know what kind of stuff I like to work on, and with what technologies. Does your organization have some kind of corporate ladder? Be 100% clear on what is required to climb it. If you have to have some kind of annual review, there should be no surprises from either party going into it. If you only check in a couple of times a year at review time, don&#8217;t be surprised when I decide to check out. </p>

<p>A good software developer will be intrinsically motivated to ship. This motivation can be crushed like an armadillo under a 747, or it can be nurtured to become a redwood.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to get my five year old daughter to play on the monkey bars at the park near our house. The problem is that she is scared, deathly afraid of falling, even though I’m right next to her and keep an arm around her waist.</p>

<p>I’ve sat down and explained to her that she doesn’t have anything to fear, and that I won’t let her fall. I asked her if she wants to overcome her fear of falling. She told me yes, and I told her the only way to overcome her fear is to do what she’s scared of and climb the monkey bars.</p>

<p>I quit my job the other day. I’ve grown tired and a little depressed from what it’s been for the last 10 years, and want a change. What I think would be great is if I worked at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>; it sounds like an amazing place and I want to be a part of that. I even made a dedicated website to show my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But, here’s the problem: I’m scared. I am incredibly afraid of how this will work. What if they tell me to get lost? What if they publicly say that I’m no good? What if they don’t respond at all? What if everyone else on the Internet looks at me and judges me to be worthless and mocks me?</p>

<p>For the last 24 hours those questions have been keeping me awake and fraying my nerves. I went out for a walk to try to calm down and thought of what I told my daughter: The only way to overcome this fear is to do it. I am still scared to death, but here we go.</p>

<time datetime="2013-05-06T00:00:00-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">May 6<span>th</span>, 2013</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">

<div><div><div><div>
<p>Functional programming has always been a bit of a mindbender for me. I’ve read plenty of tutorials on the subject, but it wasn’t until recently that it finally started to click for me.</p>

<p>The basics of partial function application involves something like this.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code"><span>var</span> <span>slice</span> = <span>Array</span>.<span>prototype</span>.<span>slice</span>; <span>// just to simplify things</span><br><span>var</span> <span>partial</span> = <span>function</span>(<span>fn</span>) {<br><span>var</span> <span>args</span> = <span>slice</span>.<span>call</span>(<span>arguments</span>, <span>1</span>);<br><span>return</span> <span>function</span>() {<br><span>return</span> <span>fn</span>.<span>apply</span>(<span>this</span>, <span>args</span>.<span>concat</span>(<span>slice</span>.<span>call</span>(<span>arguments</span>)));<br>  };<br>};</pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>
<p class="p1">Bwah?</p>
<p class="p1">What this does is take a function as a parameter. It then takes all the other parameters and hangs on to them. It returns another function, that when called, executes that first one, with the original arguments <em>and</em> any new ones you pass in.</p>
<p class="p1">Bwah?</p>
<p>Let’s use a primitive example to try to unwind this thing.</p>
<p></p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code"><span>var</span> <span>add</span> = <span>function</span>(<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) {<br><span>return</span> <span>a</span> + <span>b</span>;<br>};<br><br><span>var</span> <span>add5to</span> = <span>partial</span>(<span>add</span>, <span>5</span>);</pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>
<p>Now when you call <code>add5to(3)</code> you’ll get 8. Yes, this will always add 5 to whatever you supply to it. Yes, it is absolutely useless.</p>

<p>This is where a lot of tutorials stop, leaving you to think “OMG WHO CARES?!” and then get back to doing important things, like stamp collecting.</p>

<p>And that’s where I stopped for the longest time too. But then when I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/43382919">this video</a> a light came on to realize that this could be <em>useful</em>. You can use it to build a pretty nice DSL that creates nested DOM elements.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a function called <code>el</code> that takes  <code>tagName</code>, <code>attributes</code>, and <code>content</code> as parameters.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code"><span>var</span> <span>el</span> = <span>function</span>(<span>tagName</span>, <span>attributes</span>, <span>content</span>) {<br><span>// snip</span><br>};<br><span>var</span> <span>element</span> = <span>el</span>(<span>“div</span><span>”</span>, {<span>className</span>: <span>‘foo</span><span>’</span>, <span>id</span>: <span>‘bar</span><span>’</span>}, <span>“Hi</span> <span>I</span><span>’m</span> <span>a</span> <span>div</span>!<span>”</span>);<br><span>// results in:</span><br><span>// &lt;div id=“bar” class=“foo”&gt;Hi I’m a div!&lt;/div&gt;</span></pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>Let’s also say that if you leave out <code>attributes</code>, it treats the second parameter as <code>content</code>.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code">    <span>el</span>(<span>“p</span><span>”</span>, <span>“Call</span> <span>me</span> <span>Ishmael</span>.<span>”</span>);<br><span>// &lt;p&gt;Call me Ishamel.&lt;/p&gt;</span></pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>That in itself is a little useful, but here’s where partial function application comes in. Cram <code>el</code> into <code>partial</code> and stuff starts to get real.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code"><span>var</span> <span>div</span> = <span>partial</span>(<span>el</span>, <span>“div</span><span>”</span>);<br><span>var</span> <span>element</span> = <span>div</span>({<span>className</span>: <span>‘foo</span><span>’</span>, <span>id</span>: <span>‘bar</span><span>’</span>}, <span>“Hi</span> <span>I</span><span>’m</span> <span>a</span> <span>div</span>!<span>”</span>)</pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>In fact, we can quickly make functions for many HTML tags.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>When would be a good time to use this? When you have a bunch of functions that act similarly but vary slightly on parameters. </p>

<p>The power of this lies in that you can take an incredibly simple function, and then use it to build complex mechanisms out of it. I’m still nowhere near an expert on this, but I think this time the wrinkles in my brain may just sink in.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I bought a <a href="http://www.scion.com/cars/FR-S/">Scion FR-S</a>. It’s my first non-boring car and so far I’m really liking it. </p>

<p>To understand why, here’s my car history: <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/ford/ranger/1992/">1992 Ford Ranger</a>, <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/1998/">1998 Toyota Corolla</a>, and <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/honda/civic/2005/">2005 Honda Civic</a>. I learned manual transmission on the Ranger, but otherwise that whole lot didn’t do much to stir up passion in the souls of men.</p>

<p>Time was coming around to replace the Civic and I was considering something similarly practical, just a little bigger: an Accord or Camry, probably with the V6 option. I’ve never exactly been a gearhead, though I’ve always appreciated a nice piece of engineering when I’d seen it.</p>

<p>I had been mulling that decision over in my head when I watched a new episode of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/episode-1/id593555438?i=598468654">Top Gear</a>. It featured a new Toyota called the GT86. They gave it pretty high praise (which isn’t a given on that show), especially since it had several  traits to get quality performance, but a very economical price. I was intrigued enough to look it up, but couldn’t find it anywhere on Toyota’s website, and moved on.</p>

<p>(Note, I don’t know why I never bothered to look up its <a href="http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/brz/index.html">Subaru cousin</a>. It just never entered my head. Sometimes I am dumb.)</p>

<p>That was the end of that until it came up on the <a href="http://neutral.fm/">Neutral podcast</a>. One of the hosts mentioned that the GT86 was released in the US under Toyota’s Scion label, as the FR-S. I pulled over to look it up on my phone, and sure enough, it was there, <em>and</em> was in the same price range as the Accord and Camry.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months and I had took one for a test drive. I liked it enough and it had <em>just</em> enough room for a child’s seat in the back to get approval from my [awesome] wife. About a week later we bought it.</p>

<p>Like I said, it’s non-boring, but what does that mean? Well, first of all, the corners. Oh my, the corners. It has such a low center of gravity that you can just throw it around corners and it’ll hug them like a too tight t-shirt on a fat guy. Next is the control. We picked the automatic model because my wife has never driven stick and wasn’t terribly interested in learning. However it has a “Manual mode” which means that you can use shifters to go up and down in gear, without a clutch. This is much more fun than I thought it would be. It allows you to get a little more zip out of the engine, and hit the throttle for the to get some more power when coming out of a turn.</p>

<p>Even though the engine is <em>only</em> 200hp, it’s still more than I’ve been used to, meaning it feels faster to me. A friend of mine took me for a drive in his Mustang GT and showed me what acceleration really feels like with a V8 though.</p>

<p>This is not to say that it is all rainbows and cupcakes. The aforementioned “Manual” shifters are kind of strange. There’s two ways to shift: paddles around the steering wheel, and with the stick itself. The problem with the paddles is that they’re attached to the wheel, and therefore rotate with it. This is annoying when turning and can cause some strange hand contortions to shift. Because of this, I prefer to use the stick to shift the gears, and question the logic of the paddles altogether. You’ll notice that pricier sports cars with paddle shifters attach them to the column, so they don’t rotate. The paddles also mean the cruise control is much further down on the wheel at the 4 o’clock position.</p>

<p>The rest of the interior is lacking in gizmos that a similarly priced family sedan would have. The FR-S doesn’t have steering wheel audio controls (or anything else), satellite navigation (an option is available), automatic seats, or backup sensors. It does have bluetooth audio though, which is pretty nice (except when your wife borrows it when your phone is in range and starts blaring through the speakers).</p>

<p>A prior version of me would have cared more about the lack of those things, but I don’t miss them because the car itself is fun enough. I feel like this might very well turn me into a bit of a car guy. </p>

<p>My wife asked me to articulate why this is a “fun” car, and after thinking about it for a while I think I know why. It’s the exhiliration of taking a turn, feeling the grip on the road as you go around it tightly, and then having your stomach and senses catching up immediately afterwards. Those things aren’t necessarily dangerous, you can do them at low speeds too, but they hit the same points a rollercoaster does. If you like that, then I recommend the FR-S.</p>

<p><img src="/images/assets/game.png?format=750w" alt="Game Image"></p>

<p>Recently I put together a basic iPad game for my girls (aged 5 and 2). It’s the first real<sup>1</sup> game I’d ever created and I found the process to be interesting enough to warrant some writing. I thought it might be fun for them to have a game that stars both of them exploring the house and finding treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Thing 1.</strong> It was much easier than I thought it would be. I wanted it to have an 8 or 16 bit Zelda mechanic - top down view, dpad to move around. Turns out this is a road that has been well-trodden. I found some great tutorials and tools to make the process go fast. Of course, this didn’t prevent a couple of head-desk-smashing newbie mistakes, but overall wasn’t too bad.</p>

<p>Tools I found useful:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2d</a> The engine that runs the game. I found their API to be pretty easy to understand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a> What I used to make the map. Kind of like how Photoshop works with layers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker">Texture Packer</a> Used to make sprite sheets.</p>

<p>Lastly, I found the tutorials on <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials">raywenderlich.com</a> to be invaluable (though some of the sample code had typoes).</p>

<p><strong>Thing 2.</strong> Making graphics is <strong>not</strong> my forté. I found a lot of decent sprites and tilesets to use, but modifying them was tedious. If I ever decide to make something to release commercially, I’ll definitely have to outsource the art.</p>

<p>After some poking around I ended up using a bunch of sprites from these two sources: <a href="http://yms.main.jp/page2/tilesets.html">Pixelated world</a> and <a href="http://untamed.wild-refuge.net/rmxpresources.php?characters">Sithjester</a></p>

<p><strong>Thing 3.</strong> My girls struggled with the virtual dpad. They are quite adept and using the iPad and other kids games (especially the Toca Boca ones), but couldn’t get the knack for the dpad. It is in the lower left corner, and my older daughter kept trying to tap it with her right hand, obscuring the screen. She also kept trying to control movement by swiping, which makes sense given her background with other apps. The character on screen was probably moving too quickly for her to track easily as well.</p>

<p><strong>Thing 4.</strong> Despite Thing 3, both of them loved it. I made character sprites that resembled both of them, and recorded their voices and used them as sound effects. And the map kind of resembles our house too. We spent about a half hour taking turns while Mommy was making dinner.</p>

<p>What I discovered is that the programming and art for making a good, relatively simple game isn’t a big barrier; it’s using both of those within the boundaries of time to make a fun and compelling experience that is the challenge.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I had a lot of fun making it. Now that I have a good idea of what’s involved, I might try my hand at a real product to sell.</p>

<ol>
<li>I’d made games way back in the day on my TI calculator in High School, but those used the TI Basic and therefore don’t count. I also made a pong clone using XNA one time.</li>

<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">
<p><em>You have to crawl before you walk. You have to punch before you can Hadoken.</em> – Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post is most likely too simplistic for anyone who has done any kind of JavaScript development for a long time, but it’s always best to start at step 1.</p>
<h2>Do NOT Inline JavaScript Calls in Tags</h2>
<p>See this?</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>&lt;a href="#" onclick="DoSomething()" class="monkeys"&gt;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Don’t ever do that.</p>
<p>Why? For starters, it violates the separation of concerns. Your markup is your <em>Presentation</em>, JavaScript is not. Your JavaScript will manipulate the markup, but it is not markup itself.</p>
<p>There’s always a workaround for this too. Here’s the equivalent that is unobtrusive using jQuery (you <em>are</em> using jQuery right?):</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>$('a.monkeys').click(DoSomething);</pre></div>
</div>

<p>And you’d put that code with all the other JavaScript in a <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<h2>Keep It ALL Separate Anyways</h2>
<p>Keep all of your JavaScript in separate <code>.js</code> files. This means not having any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags that do not have <code>src</code> attributes. No sneaking in functions at the bottom of pages, or inlined in views.</p>
<p>Again, why? JavaScript hidden amongst HTML is hard to maintain. If you have a bug in a function, how do you find it? If your JavaScript is spread willy-nilly throughout everything, have fun tracking it down. This code is also hard to test; you’d have to pull in all of your markup into your test suite, which is precisely what you should not be doing for <strong>unit</strong> testing.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can’t minify inlined JavaScript, meaning you are literally slowing your app down by keeping it all spread out.</p>
<h4>The Exception</h4>
<p>The biggest exception I can think of for this rule is when you are pre-loading a bunch of data (preferably JSON). If your app is immediately making an AJAX request to retrieve data when the page loads, consider doing this to save the roundtrip:</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>&lt;script&gt;
    myApp.someCollection = @ViewBag.SomeData
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Watch Out for Globals</h2>
<p>By default all JavaScript variables are in the global namespace. This is a Bad Thing. It means that this code right here:</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>foo = function() {
    // blah blah blah
}</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Will clobber any other globally named variable named <code>foo</code>. You can limit this with the <code>var</code> keyword:</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>var foo = somethingSomething;</pre></div>
</div>

<p>But, this is a discipline, because <em>every</em> time you forget the <code>var</code> you create a global object, even if you five layers deep in an object.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Functions Small</h2>
<p>Open your JavaScript files, what’s the longest function in there? Clocking in somewhere around 100+ lines? Yeah, that’s probably too long.</p>
<p>It’s been said <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">over and over again</a>: smaller routines breed fewer bugs. It seems to endemic to JavaScript to create prolific walls of code, going 10 levels of nesting deep. Break that stuff down into shorter functions, and your life will be a little easier.</p>
<p>Ok, like I said, these are just the basics. Once you start doing them, your code will get a little bit better. Not a whole lot better, but it’s a start. Now that we can walk a little bit (maybe with a limp) we can start to jog later.</p>
