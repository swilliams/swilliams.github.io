		<p>I just got my latest computer, a 13&#8221; MacBook Pro with a Retina screen. Before my memory fades too much, I want to list the computers that I have (or my family has) owned, and talk a little about the memories associated with them. I wish I could dig up more pictures of some of these, but almost all of them were not important to be deigned worthy of being stored in the cobwebs of Internet history.</p>

<h3>Prehistory</h3>

<p><strong>Compaq Portable</strong> (some point in the late 80&rsquo;s). My dad used to bring this home every so often from his day job at a large bank. It was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_portable">&ldquo;portable&rdquo;</a> even though it weighed 28 pounds. I learned how to type on this thing and wrote a few papers in 3rd grade before my teacher told me to stop and work on my handwriting. I believe it ran MS-DOS 3.0.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="The Compaq Portable" src="/images/assets/1389282253678.jpg" />
    <figcaption>The Compaq Portable</figcaption>
</figure>


<p><strong>IBM &ldquo;Compatible&rdquo;</strong> (early 90&rsquo;s. ) Our first family computer. It had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80386">80386</a> that ran at a smoking 25 MHz. It lasted us for years and years. I wrote more school papers on it, learned how to hide certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game">games</a>) my mother wouldn&rsquo;t approve of<sup>1</sup>, and poked around with a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qbasic">QBasic</a>. It ran MS-DOS 5 and had Windows 3.1.</p>

<p>My earliest memory of this computer was learning that &ldquo;hot&rdquo; was slang for &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; because my dad was convinced that some of the parts weren&rsquo;t legal&hellip; I think he was joking. Probably.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="WordPerfect" src="/images/assets/Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png" />
    <figcaption>WordPerfect</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>I learned the ins and outs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect#WordPerfect_for_DOS">WordPerfect 5.1</a> to great effect. In 6th grade I was able to astonish one of my classmates by being able to print out 25 copies of the same document without having to re-type the whole thing 25 times.</p>

<p>My first bit of &ldquo;programming&rdquo; that I could be proud of was a batch script in DOS that would take 10 minutes to run by listing every single file on the system, counting to an insanely high number, prompt the user over and over, and generally be as annoying as possible. I would then try to get my little sister to run it as often as I could just to watch her get angry. One time I left it in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> file when my mom needed to use the computer and got in actual trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Unknown Laptop</strong> (mid-late 90&rsquo;s) Another computer we got to borrow from my dad. This time with a little known operating system called Windows 95. It was a fairly primitive laptop, though I was fascinated by the LCD and the weird colors it had unless you looked at it straight on.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really use it for much other than writing papers. Although, it was our first computer to really connect to the Internet (the old 386 had a modem, but at 2400 baud it was much to slow to be of any value). In 1997 I signed up for a Hotmail email address and thought I was pretty awesome.</p>

<p><strong>HP Desktop</strong> (early 1998) A huge upgrade from the old family PC. This sported a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium"><em>Pentium</em></a> processor and Windows 95. I remember being most excited about getting a joystick and being able to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_Fighter_(video_game)">TIE Fighter</a>, a game that was already several years old, but one that I had missed out on. It was also our first computer to come with a CD-ROM. I could listen to music <em>on my computer(!)</em>. This was going to be the PC I was going to take to college, but fate intervened.</p>

<h3>My Own Little&hellip; My Precious</h3>

<p><strong>CTX Desktop</strong> (summer 1998) I was supposed to take the above HP to school with me, and my family had grown used to having a modern computer in the house and wanted to get their own. At Best Buy<sup>2</sup> when my dad was picking it up I jokingly asked &ldquo;Hey Dad, how about I take this to school and you guys keep the older HP?&rdquo; To my surprise, he thought about it for a second, then said &ldquo;ok&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That turned out to be fortuitous for me. At The University of Arizona, I learned that it was surprisingly upgradeable for a store-bought PC. By the time I was done with it, I had upgraded the video card, hard drive, memory, sound card, and added a CD burner and network card. Pretty much everything except was replaced for the Celeron processor that shipped with it. I even tinkered with the OS too. Originally, it was loaded with Windows 98. I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; it to Windows 2000, then eventually went back to 98 because of weird USB issues.</p>

<p>Since this was the first computer I could actually call my own, I felt obligated to really get to know it. It was on this computer that I learned how to actually write code, do a little design work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">pirate music</a>, and play more games. At this point, I definitely got &ldquo;the bug&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After this, I built my own PCs for the next few years. I&rsquo;ll cover those some other time.</p>

		<p>Spurred on by a <a href="https://twitter.com/swilliams/status/420395505852506112">Twitter conversation</a>, I figured I&rsquo;d write more about my thoughts here. I&rsquo;ve always wanted a GOOD photo editor on the iPad, ever since I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fk1V5NqoD4&amp;list=PLPlyGeI5oeICPGwwp4HTdNZkpyP0flmhC">demo</a> of the very first one. There have been a few contendors, but they&rsquo;ve all fallen short.</p>

<p>iPhoto is supposed to be this solution, but the workflow is aggravating. I&rsquo;d love to take a picture on my iPhone, pull up my iPad and edit that picture on the bigger screen, then send it back to my phone (or elsewhere). But there&rsquo;s a lag while iCloud syncs, and then somehow I end up with 4 duplicates when I&rsquo;m done editing, and another lag while iCloud syncs again, <em>sigh</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve toyed with the idea of doing it myself in my head, but it&rsquo;d be pretty hard, and time consuming. If anyone is feeling particularly up for a challenge, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d do it.</p>

<p><strong>Pair with a camera.</strong> This is hard. DSLR&rsquo;s <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t have built-in wifi, and neither do most point and shoots<sup>1</sup>. But if someone does have the appropriate adapter, it&rsquo;d be killer. Bonus points for setting up some kind of ad hoc wifi network for a camera to connect to, if that&rsquo;s even possible.</p>

<p><strong>Display photos as soon as they are taken.</strong> When I press the shutter, the photo should appear on the iPad within moments. Since photos (espeically RAW) can be huge, this&rsquo;ll have to be a temporary buffer. If I start to edit a photo, hang onto it, otherwise just keep the last 10 or so around in memory on the iPad. I should be able to swipe through all of the photos in the buffer.</p>

<p><strong>Let me start editing immediately.</strong> Obviously you wouldn&rsquo;t need to add the entirety of Photoshop, but I think a certain subset would be great:</p>

<ul>
<li>RAW controls (temperature/tint, exposure, blacks, brightness, etc)</li>
<li>Curves</li>
<li>Black &amp; White manipulation</li>
<li>&ldquo;Real&rdquo; filters, based on the above controls. We already have Instagram, and don&rsquo;t need another way to make a photo look like it was a Polaroid from the 70&rsquo;s. Heck, let me make my own filters.</li>
<li>Basic touch-ups, kinda like Lightroom (smooth skin, eye brightnes, etc). Imagine just being able to draw a brightness correction with just your finger.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Simple export.</strong> This might be a problem on iOS. Don&rsquo;t draw my ire like iPhoto and it&rsquo;s syncing woes. Avoid photos.app until the very end when I <em>want</em> to put a picture in there. Maybe have a companion app for OS X and send a photo there directly from the iPad and avoid the photos app altogether (and save space).</p>

<p>You could whip through that workflow incredibly fast, and not have to fiddle with a mouse and bloated software, or iCloud lag.</p>

		<p>Did you know that at one point I had aspirations of being an entrepreneur? For the better part of 2010 and 2011 I spent every free moment I had trying to get a startup on its feet<sup>1</sup>. It was aimed at photographers to help them manage their businesses. We called it Shootsy.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that everything in that paragraph is in the past tense, and that&rsquo;s for good reason. Shootsy is for all intents and purposes, dead. Here&rsquo;s a little bit of the history behind what happened.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="shootsy-broke.png" src="/images/assets/shootsy-broke.png">
</figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s a story that&rsquo;s been told over and over: we simply ran out of time. My co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/carterdea">Carter</a> (who is now a talented, in-demand freelance designer that you should hire) moved 400 miles away to Los Angeles in the pursuit of a woman who would become his wife. As soon as he found work out there, he promptly got overloaded. My day job picked up and I got overloaded with work too. At the time I had a bad feeling about this, but plowed forward anyway.</p>

<p>The math just didn&rsquo;t work in our favor. If you have a 40 hour a week job, you can realistically<sup>2</sup> expect to have anywhere between 10-20 extra hours for a side project. If you have a family, expect that to get smaller.</p>

<p>Both of our jobs started to demand 50+ hours a week for an extended period of time, and more often than not, I simply had no time, or was just too tired to work on Shootsy. So it sat there. And sat there. And then it sat there some more. Finally after not writing any code for nearly a year, we agreed to make official what we both had known in our heads: it was done.</p>

<p>There was no other way to cut it. I had failed at launching a business.</p>

<p>The part that really stings though? How close we were. We had a few people beta testing it. We had some advisors that were going to connect us with some important people once we had shipped. I felt that the competition was weak enough to carve out a niche for ourselves<sup>3</sup>. Some important photographers were interested in trying it out.</p>

<p>Despite the whole thing, I don&rsquo;t regret trying. I learned some important things about myself in process. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m cut out to run an entire business. I&rsquo;m a pretty good second banana, but I can&rsquo;t say with 100% certainty that it&rsquo;s a good idea to have the buck stop with me. That&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow, and maybe it will change after a few more years, but it&rsquo;s a reality I have to accept.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll attempt a startup again. <a href="/words/2013/12/16/i-made-an-app">An app</a> is easier. But an app is not a business. An app can be just for fun, which is kind of what <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zartbonk/id727445952?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Zartbonk</a> is.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a> once said that you can&rsquo;t create a business as a side project. At the time, I thought I would be able to prove him wrong. Now though, he&rsquo;s absolutely right. I plan to make more apps in the future, but I don&rsquo;t think any of them will become my day job any time soon.</p>

<p>These are some comps that Carter made. They aren&rsquo;t actual screenshots, but the actual app was pretty darn close. If I could, I&rsquo;d play some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSz16ngdsG0">Sarah McLachlan</a> over it.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. I even took a 5 week leave of absence (some unpaid) from my day job to focus exclusively on it.
2. &#8220;Realistically&#8221; as in a sustainable pace. You simply can&#8217;t pull 80 hour weeks continuously without something giving.
3. I still do feel that way. You won&#8217;t ever be acquired for 9 figures, but there&#8217;s enough room to sustain a good business.

    <div class="date">








  


<time datetime="2013-12-22T00:00:00-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">Dec 22<span>nd</span>, 2013</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>There&rsquo;s a common phrase in product development called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">&ldquo;Minimum Viable Product&rdquo;</a>. It means that the first release of your software product should only do the bare minimum needed to survive. This keeps things simple, and prevents scope creep from sneaking in (I mean you could have your app <em>also</em> <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html">read email</a>, but why?).</p>

<p>For <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zartbonk/id727445952?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Zartbonk</a>, this meant that the user had to be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play sounds</li>
<li>Search sounds</li>
<li>Add more sounds (through various means)</li>
</ul>


<p>And all of that had to happen quickly, otherwise what was the point?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good feature list, but there is absolutely more to an app than just checking off a bunch of boxes. I could implement all of those features using giant rectangles with primary colors and almost no interaction. That would certainly be a Minimum Product, but not necessarily a Viable one.</p>

<p>A viable product means that it has enough going for it so that it lives; it doesn&rsquo;t just die on the vine. On a mobile device that means it isn&rsquo;t just relegated to the dreaded last screen, essentially a junk drawer for unloved apps. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just deleted altogether.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to avoid the junk drawer with Zartbonk. There are a few flourishes here and there to make it fun. Sound clips have their waveforms in the background. The progress bar is accurate as it passes across a clip. When a sound plays in the timeline<sup>1</sup> it&rsquo;s corresponding one in the grid jiggles. You can repeat a sound bite by tapping and holding a play button. I tried to add fades and pretty animations everywhere I could.</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Jiggle" src="/images/assets/jiggle.gif">
    <figcaption>Jiggle</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>All of these things took time. A <em>lot</em> of time. Remember those three bullet points up there? Implementing those was just 20% of the whole time spent on the app. The fine tuning and iterations of design took weeks and weeks.</p>

<p>And even I&rsquo;m not immune to the allure of adding more features in there. The whole purpose of the PRO option is to add more than what might be necessary, and to separate from the competition. Looking back, I might not have actually launched with some of the pro features. The timeline in particular was a very tough nut to crack, and still isn&rsquo;t as streamlined as I&rsquo;d like it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing to remember is when you have a <em>minimum</em>, it&rsquo;s time to consider adding to that. Bugs need to be fixed. Interfaces may need to be refactored. The biggest issue with Zartbonk right now is that editing is pretty painful, especially if you want to edit more than a couple of clips. It&rsquo;ll probably take a couple of weeks to get something better in, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on now.</p>

<p>I could have delayed even longer on shipping and fixed editing first, but that runs the risk of finding something else that needs to be fixed, which could threaten the entire project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with how I launched 1.0<sup>2</sup>. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but I think I was able to strike a decent balance between features and viability.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. That&#8217;s in Zartbonk PRO. What do you mean you haven&#8217;t upgraded yet?
2. Technically I launched on 1.1, which had some critical bug fixes I didn&#8217;t see until after 1.0 launched.

<p>One of my goals for this year was to create and release an iOS app. I&#8217;m cutting it close, but I think it&#8217;s finally good enough to actually tell people about it.</p>

<p>I was interested in the idea of making a soundboard for the iPad. A soundboard is something that has lots of sound effects that you can find and play quickly. Radio shows and podcasts use them, especially the &#8220;morning zoo&#8221; ones, and now you can run your own.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zartbonk/id727445952?ls=1&amp;mt=8">I hope you like it</a>. </p>

<p>In order to remove as much friction as possible from getting it into your hands, I&#8217;m going with a &#8220;freemium&#8221; model. The app is <strong>absolutely free</strong>, but has some limitations. You can unlock everything with a single in-app-purchase.</p>

<p>Out of the box it comes with a couple dozen sound effects, including my favorite, the timeless <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio">Wilhelm Scream</a>, but you can add your own too. You can add sounds from <a href="https://db.tt/7Rr3UKJ">Dropbox</a>, the built-in microphone, or search from thousands of sounds in <a href="http://freesound.org/">freesound&#8217;s library</a>.</p>

<p>I learned <strong>TONS</strong> of things in the process of making this, and I&#8217;ll certainly blog more about my journey from there to here.</p>

<p>I want to hear back from you to. <a href="http://zartbonk.com/contact">Feel free to reach out and contact me if you run into any problems or have questionsp</a>.</p>

<p>I recently watched the original Star Wars trilogy<sup>1</sup> with my 5 year old. She&#8217;s really enjoyed it and caught the bug. I&#8217;ve watched those movies probably 50 times each, but it was a new experience to watch it with my daughter. One of the things that I enjoyed in particular was the level of detail in Empire during Luke&#8217;s duel with Darth Vader.</p>

<p>The lighting and framing sets the mood appropriately. This is the darkest movie, and not very many good things happen to our heroes. Vader&#8217;s purpose here is twofold, first to capture Luke and take him to the Emperor, but also to see how strong he was. </p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t quite notice before is that he starts the duel *one-handed*. In Episode IV he used a standard two hand grip, but here with the kid fresh out of Yoda-school he felt confident enough to just use the one. It worked pretty well for him and he disarmed Luke in short order. </p>
<p>Luke eventually manages to surprise Vader and knock him off a ledge, leading to the second encounter.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>He very noticeably switches to a two-handed grip and proceeds to again show Luke exactly who is in control. At this point Luke realizes just how out-classed he is by swinging blindly around and by only luck survives and escapes.</p>

<p>For some reason, Luke decides to be stupid and looks for Vader again.</p>

<div><div><div><div><p>At this point, Vader is through messing around. He attacks viciously over and over<sup>2</sup>. Again, I <em>love</em> the camera work here. It&#8217;s a little bit lower to make Vader seem even bigger than he normally is. At this point you can understand how it was this guy that killed off most of the Jedi.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>Luke doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. He&#8217;s knocked down again, showing possibly my favorite part of this scene. Mark Hammill wasn&#8217;t ever in danger of winning any Academy Awards, but the he nails the fear here.</p>

	</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>Luke somehow manages to get back up and resume the fight, even scoring a graze on Vader&#8217;s shoulder. Vader&#8217;s had enough and with a couple quick motions cuts off Luke&#8217;s hand and proceeds to the classic &#8220;I am your father&#8221; scene. Once again the camera work is great: it&#8217;s from Luke&#8217;s point of view staring up to a triumphant Vader.</p></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>Compare his costume to Luke&#8217;s, which is now tattered. The scene ends shortly thereafter with Luke escaping.</p>

<p>My daughter is a bit talkative and will generally ask the types of questions a five year will ask during a movie. &#8220;Where is Princess Leia?&#8221; (just outside the frame, don&#8217;t worry about it) &#8220;Why are they doing that?&#8221; (a good movie will show you why, keep watching) &#8220;What&#8217;s his name again?&#8221; (Lando). But during the last bit of the fight and the reveal she just sat there and stared enrapt at the television.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s quality film-making.</p>

<hr class="footnotes">
<p><small>
1. I managed to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EN71DG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">The Theatrical Edition on DVD</a> when it was on sale at normal prices. And also the <a href="http://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD-V25-MKV-IS-OUT-NOW/topic/12713/">&#8220;despecialized&#8221; version in HD too</a>, so no painfully obvious CG dinosaurs in the background for us.
</small></p>

<p><small>
2. One of the things I liked about the end of Return of the Jedi (even though it is not nearly as good) is that the fighting style was reversed when Luke nearly kills Vader. He jumps out of the shadows and overpowers his opponent with brute force quickly and decisviely before dismembering him. The camera even follows suit with Luke ultimately standing over his fallen foe. This was much more subtle and well-executed than the ham-fisted &#8220;rhyming&#8221; that the prequels did.</small></p>

<p><a href="/words/i-think-the-cable-companies-are-screwed">We cut our cable a couple of years ago</a> and have been using Netflix/Hulu/iTunes as our primary source of television ever since. Our oldest daughter was just 3 at the time, so she has almost no knowledge of commercials. A good bi-product of that is her opinions haven&#8217;t been swayed toy and fast food advertisers. I don&#8217;t think she even knows what a Happy Meal is.</p>

<p>An unintended side effect is that she doesn&#8217;t know how excited she should have been when my wife surprised her with an outing to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Frozen</a> this morning. “What&#8217;s that?” she asked, disinterested. Fortunately, once she was told there was a princess in it she was much more excited<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>I suspect this will change as she makes her way through grade school and her friends start talking about toys and things like that, but for now it&#8217;s nice.</p>

<p><a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer">This image</a> has been circling the Internet recently. It demonstrates the peril of interrupting a programmer deep in thought: they lose their focus and can&#8217;t immediately jump back to where it was.</p>

<p>While this is definitely true, it is also true for every single other job that requires critical thought or analysis. Which is just about anything more complex than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i5OrcxwFUA">ditch digging</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the roots of the evils<sup>1</sup> in software development right now stems from pride. The notion that you&#8217;re inherently better just because you can string together a couple of while loops and use the Terminal is ridiculous.</p>

<div><div><div><p>I was a .NET programmer from almost the beginning. I did a lot of work in 1.0 and 1.1, and was excited when things like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172192.aspx">generics</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous methods</a> showed up in 2.0, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a><sup>1</sup> rocked my world (and still does) in 3.5, and more syntactic good stuff in 4.

But to jump in without having several years of background? What would that be like?</p></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>Well, now I know. I had grown kind of tired of .NET after doing it for ten years and needed a change. I decided to make the leap over the summer and focused on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and iOS.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of this changeup has been finding work that I want to do. I tried a bit of a moonshot and <a href="/words/2013/5/14/fear-of-falling-fear-of-failing-fear-of-rejection">tried to land a job at Github</a>. I did get an interview and it went pretty well, but they decided to go with someone with more experience in Rails. I don&#8217;t blame them for that, they probably got dozens (or more) applications from people who had been working with it for years and could hit the ground running. Still was a bit of a bummer though.</p>

<p>The good news is that I&#8217;m having an easier time sliding back into Rails. Web development is mostly the same if you&#8217;re using curly braces or not. I had done a big project in it a few years ago and all of the paying work I&#8217;ve had since the leap has been with Rails. I&#8217;ve learned how to <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/how-to-ride-a-dragon">write a DSL</a> and shipped some <a href="http://rubygems.org/">gems</a> and other nice things for my clients.</p>

<p>iOS is a tougher racket. It&#8217;s has been around for about 5 years, but the underpinnings of it date waaaay back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> in the 80s. Needless to say there have been quite a few updates to it over the years. Sometimes it feels like drinking from the firehouse to pick things up in it.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I know I&#8217;m missing stuff. When I was developing <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>, one of the earlier iterations wasn&#8217;t working quickly enough to smoothly scroll across the screen. I happened to come across <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-3/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen.html#opaque_vs_transparent">this section</a> in an <a href="http://www.objc.io/">obc.io</a> article and realized I wasn&#8217;t setting the <code>opaque</code> property correctly on most of the views in the app. 5 minutes and a few checkboxes later I had a 10% boost in frame rate. It makes me wonder what other low hanging fruit are out there that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>

<p>That feeling can be demoralizing, but fortunately I know that coding is an iterative process, and there is measurable improvement in my iOS code just over a few months. I just wish I could download the whole Cocoa Touch library to my brain Matrix style.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>
<img src="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/6AOpomu9V6Q/hqdefault.jpg"><div></div>
<div></div>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>
<p>Since that won&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll just keep trucking. My first iOS app is pretty much done (with a few more fixes and features to add). I have a good idea for my second. As the reps increase, so will the quality, and so will the work.</p>

<li>Seriously guys, LINQ is one of the best language features I&#8217;ve seen, ever.</li>
