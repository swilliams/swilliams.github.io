<p>It&#8217;s been a whirlwind last 48 hours, and I now finally have a few minutes. My mind is still spinning. </p>
<p></p>
<div>My Saturday, Sunday, (and part of Monday) was spent at the <a href="http://zackarias.com/workshop/">OneLight Workshop</a> that <a href="http://zackarias.com">Zack Arias</a> puts on. I&#8217;ve been following his blog for some time and as soon as I saw that he was coming to Phoenix, I jumped at the chance.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Saturday night was just a mixer to get to know Zack and the other photographers. It was at <a href="http://gangplankhq.com/">Gangplank&#8217;s workspace</a>, and if you haven&#8217;t been there before, do make the trip. They have a great vibe and community at the place. If I lived just a little bit closer, I&#8217;d frequent the place much more often.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If you&#8217;ve ever read Zack&#8217;s blog, or heard him in an interview, he is the exact same dude in person. Which I love.  When Erica and I walked into the mixer he put out his hand and said &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Zack&#8221;. I, and everyone else there knew who he was (his name was in the freaking title of the workshop), but he still introduced himself like salf-of-the-earth kind of guy that he is.</div>
<p></p>
<div>All of the morning and part of the afternoon was a lecture on lighting. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect out of this. When I hear &#8220;5 hour lecture&#8221; I look for my pillow, or start dinking around on <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams">Twitter</a>. However, the first time I checked my phone, it was already 1pm. He had managed to talk so effectively that my stomach didn&#8217;t even harass me at its normal time. This is no small feat. </div>
<p></p>
<div>I had precisely two huge light-bulb moments during the lecture too. The first was regarding dialing in the best exposure, and the second was me finally really grasping how to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse-square law</a>. These alone were worth the price of admission.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Everything else went swimmingly. The models were incredibly gracious and patient in putting up with 10 relative newbies. I&#8217;ve included my favorites from our time with them. Just in case I didn&#8217;t have enough reasons to love the guy, I stuck around for a little while longer and Zack gave me some input on <a href="http://shootsy.com">Shootsy</a>. We ended at around 2am on Monday. And yes, I had to go to work about 6 hours after that.</div>
<p></p>
<div>All in all, I would <strong>highly</strong> recommend this to anyone looking to get better at flash based lighting.</div>

					<img alt="Since I have a certain level of self-loathing I decided to upgrade our app to the latest version of Rails (as of now, 3.0.3). Rails 3 is a big upgrade and change from Rails 2. One of the biggest areas getting a facelift is the routing system. In general this guide does a great job explaining everything, but I recently ran into a rather specific wall. By default Rails prefers you to use what they call &quot;RESTful Routes&quot;. I'm rather indifferent to the idea, but I go along with it. This provides you with 7 default routes for a resource. For example, say you create routes for a Model called &quot;Photo&quot;. This will create the following routes (stolen from the aforementioned guide): This kind of approach works for 95% of my needs, but sometimes you just need to define something beyond the defaults. Say you need an action called &quot;DoThis&quot;. You can simply modify your Photo route like so:     resources :photos do         member do             get :dothis         end     end And then /photos/1/dothis will map to a dothis method in your controller. This works as expected, but I needed to submit a form to a custom route as well. So, I just added this to my member do function:     post :dothat I then attempted to submit a form to the dothat action, but got a Routing Error telling me the route wasn't found. I double checked and the URL was definitely correct.     &lt;%= form_for(@photo, :url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; 'photos', :action =&gt; 'dothat'} ) do |f| %&gt; It generated the correct URL: photos/1/dothat, which I confirmed by calling rake routes at the command line.  After searching the Interent and only getting frustrated I finally saw something that jogged my memory. In REST, 'post' is for creating new resources. I was editing my model. Simply changing it to:     put :dothat Fixed everything.  I'll attribute that mixup to years and years of having only GET and POST available drilled into my head. It doesn't exactly help that Rails doesn't use a &quot;real&quot; PUT in the form's method attribute.

(Yeah, that’s a computer in your car.) I attempted it when I was 18: it was a bunch of old PC parts inside a Dremeled-out Rubbermaid tub with a gamepad next to my parking brake to control Winamp so I could play MP3s. It was ridiculous. I had to wait until my carputer booted Windows 98 before it could play music. Even I couldn’t take this thing seriously. It lasted about 3 days until I drove over a speed bump and the CPU fell out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II" target="_blank">slot</a>. I scrapped it and just bought an MP3-CD player (the second one ever released) instead.</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>I have to admit that when I was a little younger, the thought of a <i>carputer</i> was almost irresistible. However I was just never able to cobble together the right kind of parts. I did attempt some other &#8220;questionable&#8221; computer hacks as well; they worked about as good as Marco&#8217;s.</div> </div></div>
