<p>One of my goals for this year was to create and release an iOS app. I&#8217;m cutting it close, but I think it&#8217;s finally good enough to actually tell people about it.</p>

<p>I was interested in the idea of making a soundboard for the iPad. A soundboard is something that has lots of sound effects that you can find and play quickly. Radio shows and podcasts use them, especially the &#8220;morning zoo&#8221; ones, and now you can run your own.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zartbonk/id727445952?ls=1&amp;mt=8">I hope you like it</a>. </p>

<p>In order to remove as much friction as possible from getting it into your hands, I&#8217;m going with a &#8220;freemium&#8221; model. The app is <strong>absolutely free</strong>, but has some limitations. You can unlock everything with a single in-app-purchase.</p>

<p>Out of the box it comes with a couple dozen sound effects, including my favorite, the timeless <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio">Wilhelm Scream</a>, but you can add your own too. You can add sounds from <a href="https://db.tt/7Rr3UKJ">Dropbox</a>, the built-in microphone, or search from thousands of sounds in <a href="http://freesound.org/">freesound&#8217;s library</a>.</p>

<p>I learned <strong>TONS</strong> of things in the process of making this, and I&#8217;ll certainly blog more about my journey from there to here.</p>

<p>I want to hear back from you to. <a href="http://zartbonk.com/contact">Feel free to reach out and contact me if you run into any problems or have questionsp</a>.</p>

<p>I recently watched the original Star Wars trilogy<sup>1</sup> with my 5 year old. She&#8217;s really enjoyed it and caught the bug. I&#8217;ve watched those movies probably 50 times each, but it was a new experience to watch it with my daughter. One of the things that I enjoyed in particular was the level of detail in Empire during Luke&#8217;s duel with Darth Vader.</p>

<p>The lighting and framing sets the mood appropriately. This is the darkest movie, and not very many good things happen to our heroes. Vader&#8217;s purpose here is twofold, first to capture Luke and take him to the Emperor, but also to see how strong he was. </p>
</div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t quite notice before is that he starts the duel *one-handed*. In Episode IV he used a standard two hand grip, but here with the kid fresh out of Yoda-school he felt confident enough to just use the one. It worked pretty well for him and he disarmed Luke in short order. </p>
<p>Luke eventually manages to surprise Vader and knock him off a ledge, leading to the second encounter.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>He very noticeably switches to a two-handed grip and proceeds to again show Luke exactly who is in control. At this point Luke realizes just how out-classed he is by swinging blindly around and by only luck survives and escapes.</p>

<p>For some reason, Luke decides to be stupid and looks for Vader again.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

	</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>At this point, Vader is through messing around. He attacks viciously over and over<sup>2</sup>. Again, I <em>love</em> the camera work here. It&#8217;s a little bit lower to make Vader seem even bigger than he normally is. At this point you can understand how it was this guy that killed off most of the Jedi.</p></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>Luke doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. He&#8217;s knocked down again, showing possibly my favorite part of this scene. Mark Hammill wasn&#8217;t ever in danger of winning any Academy Awards, but the he nails the fear here.</p>

		</div>
	
	</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>Luke somehow manages to get back up and resume the fight, even scoring a graze on Vader&#8217;s shoulder. Vader&#8217;s had enough and with a couple quick motions cuts off Luke&#8217;s hand and proceeds to the classic &#8220;I am your father&#8221; scene. Once again the camera work is great: it&#8217;s from Luke&#8217;s point of view staring up to a triumphant Vader.</p></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>Compare his costume to Luke&#8217;s, which is now tattered. The scene ends shortly thereafter with Luke escaping.</p>

<p>My daughter is a bit talkative and will generally ask the types of questions a five year will ask during a movie. &#8220;Where is Princess Leia?&#8221; (just outside the frame, don&#8217;t worry about it) &#8220;Why are they doing that?&#8221; (a good movie will show you why, keep watching) &#8220;What&#8217;s his name again?&#8221; (Lando). But during the last bit of the fight and the reveal she just sat there and stared enrapt at the television.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s quality film-making.</p>

1. I managed to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EN71DG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">The Theatrical Edition on DVD</a> when it was on sale at normal prices. And also the <a href="http://originaltrilogy.com/forum/topic.cfm/Harmys-STAR-WARS-Despecialized-Edition-HD-V25-MKV-IS-OUT-NOW/topic/12713/">&#8220;despecialized&#8221; version in HD too</a>, so no painfully obvious CG dinosaurs in the background for us.
</small></p>

<p><small>
2. One of the things I liked about the end of Return of the Jedi (even though it is not nearly as good) is that the fighting style was reversed when Luke nearly kills Vader. He jumps out of the shadows and overpowers his opponent with brute force quickly and decisviely before dismembering him. The camera even follows suit with Luke ultimately standing over his fallen foe. This was much more subtle and well-executed than the ham-fisted &#8220;rhyming&#8221; that the prequels did.</small></p>

<p><a href="/words/i-think-the-cable-companies-are-screwed">We cut our cable a couple of years ago</a> and have been using Netflix/Hulu/iTunes as our primary source of television ever since. Our oldest daughter was just 3 at the time, so she has almost no knowledge of commercials. A good bi-product of that is her opinions haven&#8217;t been swayed toy and fast food advertisers. I don&#8217;t think she even knows what a Happy Meal is.</p>

<p>An unintended side effect is that she doesn&#8217;t know how excited she should have been when my wife surprised her with an outing to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Frozen</a> this morning. “What&#8217;s that?” she asked, disinterested. Fortunately, once she was told there was a princess in it she was much more excited<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>I suspect this will change as she makes her way through grade school and her friends start talking about toys and things like that, but for now it&#8217;s nice.</p>

<p><a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer">This image</a> has been circling the Internet recently. It demonstrates the peril of interrupting a programmer deep in thought: they lose their focus and can&#8217;t immediately jump back to where it was.</p>

<p>While this is definitely true, it is also true for every single other job that requires critical thought or analysis. Which is just about anything more complex than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i5OrcxwFUA">ditch digging</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the roots of the evils<sup>1</sup> in software development right now stems from pride. The notion that you&#8217;re inherently better just because you can string together a couple of while loops and use the Terminal is ridiculous.</p>

I did a lot of work in 1.0 and 1.1, and was excited when things like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms172192.aspx">generics</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/0yw3tz5k.aspx">anonymous methods</a> showed up in 2.0, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a><sup>1</sup> rocked my world (and still does) in 3.5, and more syntactic good stuff in 4.

But to jump in without having several years of background? What would that be like?</p></div></div></div>

<p>Well, now I know. I had grown kind of tired of .NET after doing it for ten years and needed a change. I decided to make the leap over the summer and focused on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and iOS.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of this changeup has been finding work that I want to do. I tried a bit of a moonshot and <a href="/words/2013/5/14/fear-of-falling-fear-of-failing-fear-of-rejection">tried to land a job at Github</a>. I did get an interview and it went pretty well, but they decided to go with someone with more experience in Rails. I don&#8217;t blame them for that, they probably got dozens (or more) applications from people who had been working with it for years and could hit the ground running. Still was a bit of a bummer though.</p>

<p>The good news is that I&#8217;m having an easier time sliding back into Rails. Web development is mostly the same if you&#8217;re using curly braces or not. I had done a big project in it a few years ago and all of the paying work I&#8217;ve had since the leap has been with Rails. I&#8217;ve learned how to <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/how-to-ride-a-dragon">write a DSL</a> and shipped some <a href="http://rubygems.org/">gems</a> and other nice things for my clients.</p>

<p>iOS is a tougher racket. It&#8217;s has been around for about 5 years, but the underpinnings of it date waaaay back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> in the 80s. Needless to say there have been quite a few updates to it over the years. Sometimes it feels like drinking from the firehouse to pick things up in it.</p>

<p>The worst part is that I know I&#8217;m missing stuff. When I was developing <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>, one of the earlier iterations wasn&#8217;t working quickly enough to smoothly scroll across the screen. I happened to come across <a href="http://www.objc.io/issue-3/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen.html#opaque_vs_transparent">this section</a> in an <a href="http://www.objc.io/">obc.io</a> article and realized I wasn&#8217;t setting the <code>opaque</code> property correctly on most of the views in the app. 5 minutes and a few checkboxes later I had a 10% boost in frame rate. It makes me wonder what other low hanging fruit are out there that I&#8217;ve missed.</p>

<p>That feeling can be demoralizing, but fortunately I know that coding is an iterative process, and there is measurable improvement in my iOS code just over a few months. I just wish I could download the whole Cocoa Touch library to my brain Matrix style.</p>

<p>Since that won&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll just keep trucking. My first iOS app is pretty much done (with a few more fixes and features to add). I have a good idea for my second. As the reps increase, so will the quality, and so will the work.</p>

		<p>Before iOS 7, if you had a Bluetooth keyboard attached to your iPad, you could only access modifier keys (Command, Control, etc) through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14791056/ios-how-to-detect-the-escape-control-keys-on-a-hardware-bluetooth-keyboard">private APIs</a>. You could sneak it in through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14940898/736">selector trickery</a> and allegedly Apple would turn a blind eye. Fortunately with iOS 7, there&rsquo;s now a public API to do this.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk a bit about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/event_delivery_responder_chain/event_delivery_responder_chain.html">Responder Chain</a>. This is how events are managed in iOS. Most of the <code>UIKit</code> classes you use inherit from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIResponder"><code>UIResponder</code></a> which means that you&rsquo;ll have access to the appropriate methods. This means that you can set the scope for your keyboard shortcuts at any level in the app. I wanted to use have them registered for the entire app, so I subclassed <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html"><code>UIApplication</code></a>, though you could use a similar approach in a view or the view controller too:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="c1">// STWApplication.h</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">@interface</span> <span class="nc">STWApplication</span> : <span class="nc">UIApplication</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">NSMutableArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">_commands</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// more coming soon</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">@end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since we&rsquo;re subclassing <code>UIApplication</code>, edit <code>main.m</code> to tell it that we&rsquo;re doing so in <code>UIApplicationMain</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">@</span><span class="n">autoreleasepool</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">NSString</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">appName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">@&quot;STWApplication&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">UIApplicationMain</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">appName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">NSStringFromClass</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">STWAppDelegate</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="p">]));</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, now let&rsquo;s tell the app what key combinations are valid. iOS 7 adds a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIResponder/keyCommands"><code>keyCommands</code></a> property to UIResponder. All we need to do is override that and returning an array of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKeyCommand_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/UIKeyCommand"><code>UIKeyCommands</code></a>. Since we&rsquo;re using a <code>UIApplication</code> subclass, add this in there:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">keyCommands</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">_commands</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">UIKeyCommand</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">commandF</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">UIKeyCommand</span> <span class="nl">keyCommandWithInput:</span><span class="s">@&quot;f&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>                   <span class="nl">modifierFlags:</span><span class="n">UIKeyModifierCommand</span>
</span><span class='line'>                          <span class="nl">action:</span><span class="k">@selector</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">handleShortcut:</span><span class="p">)];</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">_commands</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="n">NSMutableArray</span> <span class="n">alloc</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nl">initWithArray:</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">commandF</span><span class="p">]];</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">_commands</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Every time a keyboard event is raised, if it matches <kbd>⌘F</kbd>, the selector <code>handleShortcut</code> will be called on the responder chain. That means you can define that method multiple times and only the most specific will be called. For example, if you defined it in <code>STWApplication</code> and in the View Controller, the <code>STWApplication</code> version will <em>never</em> be called. Speaking of <code>handleShortcut</code>, here it is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='objc'><span class='line'><span class="k">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">handleShortcut:</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UIKeyCommand</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nv">keyCommand</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">NSLog</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">@&quot;You pressed ⌘F! Good Job!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>UIKeyCommand</code> is pretty neat. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIKeyCommand_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/UIKeyModifierFlags"><code>modifierFlags</code></a> means that the app can watch for Caps Lock, Shift, Control, Alt/Option, Command, and the Number Pad. Additionally, there are some constants that  can be used for special keys like the arrows and Escape. The <a href="">developer forums</a> also had some people getting access to Tab and Return by looking for <code>\t</code> and <code>\r</code>, but I don&rsquo;t know how well those work.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you aren&rsquo;t trying to override system shortcuts. Per the docs: &ldquo;Key commands that map to known system events (such as cut, copy and paste) are automatically routed to the appropriate responder methods.&rdquo; So don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p>Now, remember how I said &ldquo;every time a keyboard event is raised&rdquo;? These events will only happen when a text input is the first responder. This means that if you want to have some fancy global shortcuts (say ⌘F to jump to a search box) you&rsquo;ll still need to do a trick with <code>UITextField</code> (or similar). That&rsquo;s a little beyond the scope of this article, but the gist is add a UITextField to a view, hide it, and make sure it stays first responder when appropriate in order to keep firing off those events.</p>

<p>I for one am psyched that this is now available. It&rsquo;s definitely more of a power user feature, but those of us who like to use Bluetooth keyboards with our iPads will derive tremendous benefit from it.</p>

		<p>I have three digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera">SLR</a> cameras<sup>1</sup>, and a bunch of nice lenses to go with them. I&rsquo;ve been an <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">amateur photographer</a>, and have taken tens of thousands (if not more) photos of weddings, portraits, and landscapes over the years. I love my photography gear, and even though I don&rsquo;t use it quite as much as I used to, I&rsquo;m not going to be changing it any time soon.</p>

<p>But, with a few exceptions, I don&rsquo;t think anyone should buy a DSLR anymore.</p>

<p>DSLRs are big. Like, Orca big. Newer models have been hitting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqOZ1JkFFE">Slim-Fast</a>, but you are never going to be able to fit one in a pocket or purse any time soon. This means you will need a dedicated bag or backpack, which means you won&rsquo;t be taking it with you, ever. Part of the reason smartphones have replaced point &amp; shoots is that you always have it with you.</p>

<p>DSLRs are like gym memberships. People pay lots of money for them, use them for about a month, and then never again.</p>

<p>Instead, if you really want to drop several hundred dollars on a camera, get a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">mirrorless</a>. They&rsquo;re a little bit cheaper, will give you the same quality, and are <strong>much</strong> smaller. If I were starting over today, I&rsquo;d get one. <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-follow-up-review-life-without-dslrs/">Even some pros are using them for day to day work.</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some models to check out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00836H2BI/thepetzoo-20">Sony NEX-F3</a> &ndash; <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-sony-nex-f3-is-our-favorite-affordable-mirrorless-camera-so-far/">The Wirecutter likes this one</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096WDAIM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096WDAIM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Olympus E-PM2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DCM0E5Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DCM0E5Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Fujifilm X-M1</a> &ndash; A bit pricier</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these are small and light. All of them will take great photos. And, you might actually take it with you.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Here are the two people who should probably stick with DSLRs: the Student and the Professional.</p>

<p>By Student I mean someone who wants to <em>learn</em> photography. Someone who wants to know what f-stops are, how they interact with shutter speeds and ISO. If you just want to take pictures of your kids or pets, then go with one of the mirror-less ones.</p>

<p>And, by Professional, I mean someone who wants to make money with their camera. For a bunch of reasons not worth getting into, an SLR is probably the right choice for them. Professional doesn&rsquo;t have to be full-time either (I&rsquo;m certainly not).</p>
