<p>I usually don&#8217;t like to commentate on tech news; there are more than enough people doing that already. Let&#8217;s just let this be a freebie and be done with it, K?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/23/4651536/who-will-be-the-next-microsoft-ceo">Steve Ballmer is retiring from Microsoft within the next year.</a> People are quick to call him out as a &#8220;terrible&#8221; CEO. I think terrible is a little harsh. I wouldn&#8217;t call him &#8220;great&#8221; or maybe even &#8220;good&#8221;. Probably just &#8220;average&#8221; instead.</p>

<p>Under his watch, profits and revenues went up significantly<sup>1</sup>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/20/with-19b-in-revenue-microsofts-server-and-tools-chief-says-hes-just-getting-started-interview/">their enterprise market grew into a success</a>, and the Xbox became a household name.</p>

<p>But I think he&#8217;ll be remembered most of all for all the things that Microsoft squandered or was caught flat-footed for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Music. Microsoft introduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plays_for_sure">PlaysForSure</a> and then replaced it with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune">Zune</a> as Apple was gearing up to launch the iPhone.</li>
<li>Mobile. After having a headstart and early lead, the iPhone and Android just whalloped them.</li>
<li>Mobile, again. Tablets are a huge market. Microsoft just took a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/07/18/microsoft-takes-900-million-writeoff-on-struggling-surface-tablet/">$900M write-off on theirs</a>, and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/windows/microsoft-news/microsoft-surface-rt-price-slashed-150/240158217">reduced prices to try to induce demand</a>. This after having a &#8220;tablet&#8221; on the market in 2005. </li>
<li>Search. Social.</li>
<li>Online docs. They could still pull this one out though. </li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s MO has always been to let others establish a market, then enter it and dominate. Under Gates that worked well for them, but under Ballmer things moved too quickly for that strategy. With few exceptions, that never changed.</p>

<p>Ballmer ultimately did better than some other tech CEOs of his time (Jonathan Schwartz, Carly Fiorina, Léo Apotheker, most Yahoo CEOs), but the unrealized potential and missed opportunities will be his legacy. He did an Ok job all things considered, but Microsoft needs a CEO better than Ok. </p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23815563">The company has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits under Mr Ballmer&#8217;s leadership.</a> </li>
</ol>

This video <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/07/tesla-plant-video/">(and article)</a> of the Tesla plant hits all the right spots in my nerd brain: technology, robots, nice cars. And it passed the 5 year old test (&#8220;Can we watch it again Daddy?&#8221;) too. </p></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>
<p>I like Tesla cars quite a bit. If I had a spare $60-70k to burn on a car, I just might get a Model S. </p>

<p>Which is why I find it particularly frustrating when they pull marketing like this. </p>

			</div>
			

		</div>
	
	</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>
<p>That $580 isn&#8217;t as low as it once was, but the snake oil in that ad has already been covered by <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/04/02/the-strange-maths-of-teslas-500month-model-s/">plenty of others</a>. If you need a 3 line asterisk to describe the &#8220;true cost of ownership&#8221; of your product, your message might be a little muddled. The cars could <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1301_2013_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_tesla_model_s/viewall.html">practically market themselves</a>, but the leadership of the company seems to think it&#8217;s not enough and stoops to this level.</p>

<p>These things seem at odds with each other, but I think there is a line to walk. I can like the cars/engineering/tech for what they are, and try to close my eyes when their marketing goes bananas. It&#8217;s not like I have a vote in the situation, democratically or dollar-wise, anyway. (Plus, rooting for brands is just dumb.) </p>

<p>Sooo, the best course of action is to just knuckle down and use a UIWebView to display what you want.</p>

<p>To try to keep things relatively sane, I first added a static <code>html</code> file to my project with this content:</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code"><span>&lt;html</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;head</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;title</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/title</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;style</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>html</span>, <span>body</span>, <span>div</span> {<br><span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>#3D3D3D</span>;<br><span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>HelveticaNeue-Medium</span>, <span>Helvetica</span>;<br><span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>12pt</span>;<br><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FAFAF1</span>;<br>       }<br><br><span>a</span> {<br><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FAFAF1</span>;<br>       }<br><span>&lt;/style</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/head</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;body</span><span>&gt;</span><br>     REPLACEME<br><span>&lt;/body</span><span>&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/html</span><span>&gt;</span></pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>
<p>The CSS code is inlined in the file. There&#8217;s probably a way to keep it separate and inject it, but I didn&#8217;t need anything fancier than this.</p>

<p>Loading it was pretty straightforward:</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><pre class="source-code">+ (NSString *)htmlTemplate {<br>  NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"html-template" ofType:@"html"];<br>  return [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];<br>}   <br></pre></div></div></div></div>
<div><div>
<div><div><p>Then on my controller I called this method from <code>viewDidLoad</code>:</p></div></div>
<div><div><pre class="source-code">- (void)setContentText:(NSString *)contentText {<br>  NSString *template = [MyTemplateManager htmlTemplate];<br>  NSString *htmlText = [template stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"REPLACEME" withString:contentText];<br>  [contentView loadHTMLString:htmlText baseURL:nil];<br>}   <br></pre></div></div>
<div><div><p><code>contentView</code> is the <code>UIWebView</code>. Almost done. If you tap on a link in the webview it&#8217;ll open that link in itself, which might not be what you want. The way around it is to set your controller to be a <code>UIWebViewDelegate</code> and implement <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2899793/736">this method</a>:</p></div></div>
<div><div><pre class="source-code">- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {<br>  if (navigationType == UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkClicked) {<br>    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[request URL]];<br>    return NO;<br>  }<br>  return YES;<br>}</pre></div></div>
<div>
<div><div><div><p>That&#8217;ll open it in Safari. If you want other browsers, well, knock yourself out. This is pretty much a giant mess for something that should be easy, but it&#8217;s just something that would have to be done if you want total control over the UI. The end result looks well enough:</p></div></div></div>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a finicky sleeper. I don&#8217;t like tiny lights on when I try to sleep, and I don&#8217;t like sounds either. So, when a cricket managed to work its way into my bedroom, it sounded like a marching band playing <a href="http://youtu.be/a-7XWhyvIpE?t=59s">Sousa</a>.</p>

<p>The first night he started to sing his song at about 11, right when I was falling into a deep sleep. I couldn&#8217;t find him that night, but I think I made enough of a racket to scare him off, or I just fell back asleep quickly enough to be too unconcsious to hear him again. The next night was different.</p>

<p>The problem with crickets is that their sound tends to echo and makes it difficult to determine where they are, especially if you have one ear smothered by a pillow. I couldn&#8217;t tell if he was coming from the bathroom, outside a window, behind the dresser, or somewhere else.</p>

<p>The second night I took the ninja approach. When he started doing his thing, I crept out of bed,  stood up, and listened. Sounded like it was coming from the bathroom. I took two steps towards forward, and he stopped. I stood absolutely still for a few minutes until he started again. <em>Definitely the bathroom</em>, I thought. I took a few more steps and made it to the entry way of the bathroom before he stopped again. My rudimentary echo-location skills told me it was coming from under the sink. I turned on the light and flung open the doors. I ransacked everything under the sink like a DEA agent searching for cocaine. </p>

<p>Nothing. Clever girl.</p>

<p>But, rather than admit defeat, I persevered. I turned the bathroom light off, sat on the ground, and waited. Minutes ticked by with the speed of a handicapped turtle, and I kept waiting. Finally he started to make his sound again. <em>Just to my left!</em> I turned the light on again scanned the ground. <em>There!</em> Right under crack of the door to the commode. </p>

<p>He was tiny, but with a couple of quick smashes of my sandal he was no more and I flushed that bugger right down the toilet he was hiding next to. I slept soundly that night knowing that my victory was complete.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t save full paths to resources in your iOS app<sup>1</sup>. 
I&#8217;m working on an iPad application, and this just bit me pretty hard.</p>

<p>Your application lives in a directory kind of like this: <code>/blah/blah/blah/Applications/EE8E3EBF-A7A9-4680-81D0-BB5E7DFE859E/Thing.app/</code> That big old string of capital letters and numbers is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guid">GUID</a>, which means that your app is guarenteed to have its own unique folder in the file system. What I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> know was that this will change every time you update the app. This behavior doesn&#8217;t happend during development/debugging.</p>

<p>I was storing the whole path to audio files in a database<sup>2</sup>, so when I released a second beta to my testers, all their clips from the first beta stopped working and caused crashes because the app was looking for files in paths that no longer existed.</p>

<p>The fix was to only store the filename of the audio because the whole path could just be generated at runtime, and then migrating everyone&#8217;s data to the new way (which also was bug prone).</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t ever accuse me of burying the lede.</li>
<li>This would&#8217;ve happened if those values were stored in a plist, xml file, or anywhere.</li>

<div><div><p>First up was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/">Pacific Rim</a>. This is the personification of &#8220;summer movie&#8221;. It&#8217;s loud, more than a little ridiculous, and about as subtle as the giant robots that are featured in it. I generally dislike most movies that fit in that genre (e.g. Michael Bay), but this managed to do the things those movies do while having a heart about it. Yes, it requires a bit of disbelief suspension, but it knows that, and uses it to roll you in its tidal wave. I left the theater blown away by what I had just seen and feeling a little bit battered in the process. </p></div></div>
</div></div>
<div>
<div><div><div>
<p>The other was the polar opposite: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3431967744/tt2084989">Upstream Color</a>. No explosions, robots, or any special effects. However, I was also entranced by it. It was made by Shane Carruth, who also made the time-travel-mind-messer-upper Primer. It has gorgeous cinematography and incredible characters. Even if things are a little hard to follow, you can get the gist just by the emotions that the characters exude.</p>

<p>Both movies are spectacles, but in completely different ways. In Pacific Rim, each encounter ratchets the tension up a bit, then let&#8217;s off a little steam. In Upstream Color, you are sucked more and more into the main characters&#8217; lives and see how they cope with their experiences. And at the end of both there is just a great emotional release that hits home. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://youtu.be/8d4-AUwkKAw">YouTube video</a> linked from <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/18/multiplane">Marco Arment</a> (riffing on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/06/multiplane.html">this post by Manton Reece</a>) is awesome. It&#8217;s Walt Disney describing Disney animation&#8217;s Multiplane camera, which was used to provide a much better sense of depth and movement in their feature films. Some points I took away from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much they shared that could be considered a &#8220;trade secret&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know much about the history of animation, and it very could be that this was old news at the time, but you don&#8217;t see too many companies revealing how their technology works in that level of detail.</li>
<li>How educational it was. It&#8217;s just seven and a half minutes long, but you&#8217;ll learn how traditional cell based animation worked, how it limits perspective, and how the &#8220;new&#8221; multiplane camera fixed that.</li>
<li>Walt Disney called them &#8220;cartoons&#8221;. Not &#8220;animations&#8221; or &#8220;films&#8221; or anything else.</li>
<li>The acting from the guys moving the camera is hilarious.</li>

<p>The iOS 7 beta bug had bit me, but I wasn&#8217;t about to install it on my primary iPhone, therein lay madness. I had a bit of cash running around and decided to buy a spare iPod Touch to install the beta.</p>

<p>I went to the Apple store and asked to purchase a <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/">32 GB black model</a>. I chatted with the clerk for a bit and told him it was only going to be a development device. He mentioned that the <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch_16gb">16 GB version</a> was available too. I had thought that the 16 GB was last year&#8217;s model with the 3.5&#8221; screen still hanging around to hit the $229 price point. He replied that it had been recently updated with the newer tech, just no camera, less RAM, and so on. Since I didn&#8217;t need those for my particular purposes, I just bought that one.</p>

<p>How many other stores would talk a customer out of $70? Contrast this to Best Buy and I&#8217;d be out of an extra $70 and have to deal with a hard sale for a case, warranty, and accessories. This is why Apple retail  can&#8217;t be underestimated.</p>

<p>The job market is red hot for software developers right now. Last time I was looking for a job, I made the mistake of putting my resume on CareerBuilder. I ended up having to fend recruiters off with a <a href="/words/havent-heard-back-yet">pointy stick</a>. The problem was that 100% of the jobs they were throwing at me were awful. I ended up going with a reference from a prior colleague.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get a job, but I want a place that I can stay at long term. I&#8217;m not necessarily looking for an employer that has all sorts of &#8220;perks&#8221; either. Ping-pong, video games, masseuses, free food, and go-karts are neat and all, but feel a bit like coddling to me. It tends to hide the teeth used to induce all kinds of ills too.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to feel valued. Value means that what I do makes a difference, and isn&#8217;t just there to fill a time sheet. Not everything is going to send people to the moon, I get that, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be the icy grip of death either.</p>

<p>How would an employer show that they value me? Know <em>how</em> I&#8217;m doing, and not just <em>what</em> I&#8217;m doing. Know what kind of stuff I like to work on, and with what technologies. Does your organization have some kind of corporate ladder? Be 100% clear on what is required to climb it. If you have to have some kind of annual review, there should be no surprises from either party going into it. If you only check in a couple of times a year at review time, don&#8217;t be surprised when I decide to check out. </p>

<p>A good software developer will be intrinsically motivated to ship. This motivation can be crushed like an armadillo under a 747, or it can be nurtured to become a redwood.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to get my five year old daughter to play on the monkey bars at the park near our house. The problem is that she is scared, deathly afraid of falling, even though I’m right next to her and keep an arm around her waist.</p>

<p>I’ve sat down and explained to her that she doesn’t have anything to fear, and that I won’t let her fall. I asked her if she wants to overcome her fear of falling. She told me yes, and I told her the only way to overcome her fear is to do what she’s scared of and climb the monkey bars.</p>

<p>I quit my job the other day. I’ve grown tired and a little depressed from what it’s been for the last 10 years, and want a change. What I think would be great is if I worked at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>; it sounds like an amazing place and I want to be a part of that. I even made a dedicated website to show my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But, here’s the problem: I’m scared. I am incredibly afraid of how this will work. What if they tell me to get lost? What if they publicly say that I’m no good? What if they don’t respond at all? What if everyone else on the Internet looks at me and judges me to be worthless and mocks me?</p>

<p>For the last 24 hours those questions have been keeping me awake and fraying my nerves. I went out for a walk to try to calm down and thought of what I told my daughter: The only way to overcome this fear is to do it. I am still scared to death, but here we go.</p>
