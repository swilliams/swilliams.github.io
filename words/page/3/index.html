		<p>Developers tend to plow through the path of least resistance. Any amount of friction they encounter tends to be routed over or around. For example, I&rsquo;ve worked at a place where Sharepoint was the mandated document storage for the company. The problem is that Sharepoint is awful and unless it was setup by experts, difficult to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.<sup>1</sup> Since it was so convoluted, developers ignored it.</p>

<p>This lead to bigger problems. A sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition">oral tradition</a> was inadvertently created and persisted. Since developers were ignoring documentation, requirements were missed and features were implemented incorrectly. Fingers were pointed and words were exchanged.</p>

<p>Now, imagine for a moment you were the manager in charge of this lot and suddenly found out that your document system was completely ignored by everyone on your team. Bad managers try to correct this with the heavy-handed approach and enforce the IT policy. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen and it isn&rsquo;t pretty. It usually results in the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166626/divine-right-of-kings">Divine Right of Management</a> being invoked, and then rapidly returns to status quo when said manager is not looking.</p>

<p>What should you do instead? Keeping that convoluted game of telephone doesn&rsquo;t work, and erects huge barriers for any new person. <a href="http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Pave_the_Cowpaths">Paving the cowpaths</a> may not necessarily be the best approach either because it could cement bad practices<sup>2</sup>. Anarchy is not a reliable cowpath.</p>

<p>Being a good manager is about removing the friction from your team to enable them to do good work. What&rsquo;s the friction in the above scenario? Dealing with a crummy document management system. How do you remove that? One team I&rsquo;ve worked with used a Github based workflow for source code and started using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis">wikis</a> on Github. Another place used Trello, which required more management, but it was still easy to look stuff up. Heck, you could even have an expert come over and wrestle Sharepoint into being manageable.</p>

<p>Like everything else, there isn&rsquo;t a silver bullet here. In fact, so-called silver bullets tend to create these scenarios (all of the bullet points on the box sure looked good to somebody in a position of authority). A good manager will know their team and understand where these points of friction occur. It might be impossible to smooth them over entirely, but every single bit you can scrape away will only make your team more productive.</p>

1. This shouldn&#8217;t be a Sharepoint gripe fest, but here&#8217;s the process you had to go through to find a document if you didn&#8217;t have a good bookmark. 1) Go to the home page. 2) Click on the &#8220;IT Projects&#8221; &#8220;portal&#8221;. 3) Find the right project in a list on the sidebar. 4) Navigate that project&#8217;s folder hierarchy. Each project&#8217;s hierarchy is completely arbitrary and built by its own madman. 5) Find the document eventually. It&#8217;s a Word doc so, 6) Download the doc. 7) Open it. 8) Edit it. 9) Re-upload it.

I&#8217;ll get back to you in an hour.&#8221;

<p>I bought a new camera a little while ago, and finally had the opportunity to put it through its paces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=2PJ4FLG2K25KQBDP">The Fujifilm X100s</a> isn&rsquo;t particularly cheap, so I saved a while to be able to afford it, but so far I&rsquo;m really liking it.</p>

<p>I have three Nikon DSLRs and an assortment of nice lenses to go with them, so why would I want a smaller, almost Point and Shoot camera? For starters, it&rsquo;s much smaller. I love my Nikons, but carrying around a backpack has never been <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr/">convenient</a>, especially when you need to take a shot fast. It can fit in a large pocket, and I have a belt-style pouch for it too. Its lens is fixed at about the equivalent of 35mm on an SLR. You&rsquo;d think being stuck at a single focal length would be an issue, but it&rsquo;s a good size for when its use cases (informal portraits, walking around, &ldquo;street&rdquo; photography). Oh yeah, and the pictures that come out of it are gorgeous.</p>

<p>Where doesn&rsquo;t it stand up very well? When you need to get closer. When you need the absolute <em>best</em> image quality. When you need a high frame-rate of shots (sports). I wouldn&rsquo;t shoot a wedding with just the X100s, but it would be very useful for wandering around during the reception.</p>

<p>Despite those issues, this is probably my go to camera for 80% of my needs right now. If it had been available 10 years ago when I was considering a DSLR purchase, I might&rsquo;ve gone with this instead.</p>

<time datetime="2014-05-12T13:16:18-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">May 12<span>th</span>, 2014</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I&rsquo;m learning <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> in efforts to stay <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/01/20/keep-your-developer-saw-sharp/">reasonably up to date</a> with client side web technologies. <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/05/06/oh-cool-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer/">This hasn&rsquo;t been the easiest going.</a></p>

<p>Ember&rsquo;s best feature is that it easily binds values in HTML to their corresponding properties on objects. I&rsquo;ve found the implementations of this a little confusing sometimes. Going through the Getting Started guide has been helpful, though <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/displaying-the-number-of-incomplete-todos/">this part tripped</a> me up for a good hour, specifically this snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Within todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That last line turns the associatied method into a <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/">computed property</a>.  My understanding of computed properties was as a means to provide a simple call to complex data (eg. a <code>fullName</code> property that joins <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> properties). This particular method is on a <em>controller</em>, has a previously foreign syntax (<code>@each</code>), and the template that refers to it still uses it&rsquo;s canonical name (<code>remaining</code>).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/assets/ember/zoidberg.gif" alt="Wha?" />
</figure>


<p>In order to understand just what was happening, I pumped the brakes and dug into the sample application. My first question was why they were using a computed property altogether. I whipped up another method and added it to my controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>todos {{derp}}<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This resulted in the method body being substituted in the template, which reminded me that <code>{{derp}}</code> was just printing out whatever <code>derp</code> evaluated to, in this case a function.<sup>1</sup> So I made <code>derp</code> a computed property:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;what&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This worked. My <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was now &lsquo;todos derp!&rsquo;. In fact, you could simplify it even more by doing this: <code>property()</code> and leaving off a name altogether. It also demonstrated that the first argument to <code>property</code> didn&rsquo;t have a bearing on what goes in the Template. Next step was to substitute my static text with something useful.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And sure enough, the title was now &lsquo;todos 2&rsquo;. I suspected this would work because my controller extended <code>Ember.ArrayController</code>, giving it access to <code>filterBy</code>. This lead me back to one of my original questions: what is the purpose of <code>'@each.isCompleted'</code>?</p>

<p>I played around with the todo app a little more and noticed that my <code>{{derp}}</code> was not automatically updating when todos where checked off while the original <code>{{remaining}}</code> was. Then it hit me: <code>'@each'</code> must be a special directive for an <code>ArrayController</code> that bound that function to the <code>isCompleted</code> property of <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.ArrayController.html#property__each"><em>each</em></a> object in its array. Putting a <code>console.log('called');</code> confirmed this suspicion — it&rsquo;s called every time <code>isCompleted</code> is accessed.</p>

<p>After this bit of forensics, things make a little more sense now. I do wish this association was a little more spelled out in the documentation though for us thick-headed developers.</p>

		<p>Most people who have even heard of it would say that it&rsquo;s a Twitter clone, created out of <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/what-twitter-could-have-been">frustrations over the direction it was heading</a>. Currently, the <a href="http://app.net">home page</a> makes it look like an identity and/or messaging service. Over the last couple years, it&rsquo;s bounced around and offered different services. According to the founders, the <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">genesis</a> of it was to create a backend-as-a-service to enable developers to make the next generation of online applications.</p>

<p>The problem was that I don&rsquo;t think App.net ever moved beyond the shadow of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Twitter clone.&rdquo; App.net&rsquo;s API does offer the capabilities to make some really <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">slick</a> <a href="http://favd.net/">apps</a>, but there hasn&rsquo;t been any one thing that captured everyone&rsquo;s attention to make them say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; There is the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/">microblogging service</a>, the <a href="https://omega.app.net/">messaging service</a>, the <a href="https://broadcast.app.net">broadcast service</a>, the <a href="https://backer.app.net/">crowdfunding service</a> and <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/">the cloud storage service</a>. If you&rsquo;re being unkind, you could call them the Twitter clone, the iMessage clone, the Push Notification clone, the Kickstarter clone, and the Dropbox clone. Each of those services are good, but none of them have differentiated themselves from their biggest competitors. If all of those went dark tomorrow, everybody would be able to move back to what they were using before without too much trouble.</p>

<p>There was a great initial fervor when App.net launched. Some big names supported it both vocally and financially. Unfortunately, their engagement petered out over time. The most damning evidence of this? Out of all the people on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801133202/https://join.app.net/">this page</a> the only person who still interacts on App.net regularly is <a href="https://alpha.app.net/garrytan">Garry Tan</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I was very bullish on App.net, which makes the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/">latest news</a> saddening. It isn&rsquo;t the end yet, but when you have literally no employees working on a service and suspend the biggest <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">incentive to develop on your platform</a>, it isn&rsquo;t too far away. Right now the best case I see for App.net is
that it continues along as is, but with little to no growth. I did renew my paid account this year, but I don&rsquo;t know if the service will be around for another renewal next time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like armchair quarterbacking. Saying what <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/woman-a-leading-authority-on-what-shouldnt-be-in-p,35922/">should have been done</a> is too easy and requires no effort on my part. I do think that a lesson to take away from this is that identity is important and needs to be clear to customers.</p>

1. It looks like <a href="https://alpha.app.net/peterrojas">Peter Rojas</a> and <a href="https://alpha.app.net/andrewchen">Andrew Chen</a> have feeds that syndicate to App.net. Nobody else on that list had any kind of post within the last month.

<p>And as pointed out by <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chriskrycho/post/29913830">Chris Krycho</a>, it looks like Garry&#8217;s posts are just cross-posted from Twitter using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/6/bio/53">Ed Catmull</a> knows a thing or two about making Great Things. In 2007 he gave a talk at Stanford about how Pixar does their thing. It&rsquo;s almost an hour long but you should watch it.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k2h2lvhzMDc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Some of the things that resonated with me and are just as applicable in other practices:</p>

<p>Present work <em>every day</em>. Even if it is incomplete or sucks. Why? It forces collaboration. If everybody is bumping up against each other, ideas will spread. Problems don&rsquo;t fester either; if someone is struggling on some task for too long it becomes apparent and somebody else can lend a hand if necessary.</p>

<p>Success hides problems. This might be the biggest one. It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss problems during times of feast. Catmull also mentioned that they have an open-door policy for everyone and strive to make it safe for <em>everyone</em> to tell the truth. This is hard to do. Even if the CEO&rsquo;s door is open, rank-and-file employees will simply feel <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080901/how-hard-could-it-be-how-i-learned-to-love-middle-managers.html?partner=fogcreek">intimidated walking in and stating their mind</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this, Pixar introduced post-morterms; essentially a discussion after the completion of a project to highlight what worked and what didn&rsquo;t. These can be annoying, which means that people will game them, even unintentionally. Pixar found that they had to change up the post-morterms every time in order to get real value from them.</p>

<p>What it boiled down to was that their goal was to create teams of good people that functioned well together. Good people don&rsquo;t tolerate nonsense. If you give a bad idea to a good group, they&rsquo;ll fix it, or throw it away and come up with a better one. A group of mediocre people will take a good idea and screw it up. Therefore, hiring the right people, and then managing them is critical.</p>

<p>Human organziations are inherently unstable and fall over slowly. The fall is slow, but the collapse is quick. The more I experience I get, the more I see people management as a critical role on any project with more than one person. A good project manager constantly takes information from the team and acts on that in order to avoid the fall.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With news of the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">heartbleed vulnerability</a> I&rsquo;ve taken the <strike>paranoid</strike> precautionary measure of changing all my passwords. I have over 200 logins in my <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a><sup>1</sup> library, so I&rsquo;ve seen just about every kind of password change process imaginable over the last day or two. My conclusion is that there are a lot of <strong>terrible</strong> implementations of this process.</p>

<p>Security conflicts with convenience, and changing passwords is never convenient. But there are ways to at least make it quick. Here&rsquo;s what I expect when I got to a site to change my password:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sign in.</li>
<li>Click something like &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Account&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Profile&rsquo;. Ideally, there should only be one of those on the page to avoid guessing.</li>
<li>Have the word &lsquo;password&rsquo; on that Settings page. Be it a button, link, or inline form, just make it easy to find.</li>
<li>If I need to enter my old password first, make it the first field.</li>
<li>Display some kind of notification that my change was successful.</li>
<li>Optionally, send me an email telling me it changed, just in case a bad guy did it.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s not so bad right? This has been the standard way of doing things ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgi-bin">cgi-bin</a> was a thing. But so many websites get it wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, <em>have</em> a Change Password form. More than a couple sites I went to don&rsquo;t have one and rely on you to do the Reset My Password dance. This means I have to sign out, go back to the sign in page, click the reset link, enter my email, wait for the email, open the email, click the link in the email, then finally enter a new password. Shame on you if you make me do this. Shame.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict password length. 1Password let&rsquo;s me create a 50 character password, yet I&rsquo;d say at least 40% of the sites I went to couldn&rsquo;t handle a password that long.</li>
<li>If you have to restrict length for some reason, tell me exactly what that maximum is.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
    <img alt="Password WTF" src="/images/assets/password-wtf.png" />
</figure>


<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict what characters I can use. There is no technical reason I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to use spaces or symbols in a password.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t restrict copy/paste in the password field. Paypal was the only one I saw that did this, and it boggles my mind. A random, complex password is going to be more secure than one I can easily type in (which can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_tables">cracked quickly</a>). Don&rsquo;t actively prevent me from trying to make my financial data secure!</li>
</ul>


<p>Security already has its own set of barriers, and a certain subset of people will never take it seriously. As a web developer, it is entirely up to you to keep that subset from growing in size.</p>

<time datetime="2014-03-06T13:13:51-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 6<span>th</span>, 2014</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the <a href="/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages">pre-history</a>, and then the <a href="/words/2014/01/25/my-computers-through-the-ages-part-ii">awkward years</a>. Now we come at last to the present. From here on out, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> all the way down, so if that ruins your day, please feel free to stop reading and go outside to contemplate your existance.</p>

<p>Why did I switch? Most of it came down to what I use a computer for. I&rsquo;m a software developer by trade. The first part of my career was mostly in the Microsoft stack, but by the late 2000&rsquo;s I got the itch to move on to <a href="/words/2013/12/02/the-frustrations-of-the-journeyman/">something else</a>. Every kind of development platform that I&rsquo;m interested in runs better on a Unix-like system. Apple doesn&rsquo;t make me happy 100% of the time, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be leaving their ecosystem for a while.</p>

<p><strong>24&#8221; iMac</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp507">(2009)</a> I&rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting when I made the switch, but I wasn&rsquo;t terribly fond of this one. The hardware was great; a beautiful display, pretty fast processor, and a spacious hard drive. I loved that I didn&rsquo;t have a beige butt-ugly tower on my desk anymore. My frustrations were entirely with OS X.  It came with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/">10.5 Leopard</a>, with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/snowleopard/">10.6 Snow Leopard</a> released shortly after the computer showed up on my porch. After upgrading, it had a myriad of reliability problems. What made me grind my teeth were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_panic">kernel panics</a>. A kernel panic is an error in the Operating System that it cannot recover from, stopping everything and requiring a restart. You might be familiar with its colloquial name on Windows: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_XP_BSOD.png">Blue Screen of Death</a>. I would average one of those every month on my iMac, which is astronomically high for an OS marketed with <a href="http://a3.img.mobypicture.com/570253fecab177d9605be5d157c59e18_view.jpg">&ldquo;it just works&rdquo;</a> as its slogan.</p>

<p>It frustrated me enough that I considered going back to Windows. What held me back was that I had started getting more and more into <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> development, which (still) doesn&rsquo;t run very well on Windows<sup>1</sup>. I had started to work on a <a href="/words/2013/12/26/whither-shootsy-or-how-i-tried-and-failed-a-startup">Rails based project</a> that would have benefited from having a laptop in order to work outside the house. Despite my initial reservations for OS X, I doubled down.</p>

<p><strong>13&#8221; MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp583">(2010)</a> This was the cheapest Mac laptop at the time. With impeccable timing, I bought this right before Apple released the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Airs</a>. This wasn&rsquo;t a particularly fast computer, but it showed me how well OS X could work when it doesn&rsquo;t constantly blow up. I don&rsquo;t know if my iMac was a bit of a lemon, or if OS X just works better on laptops, but it was noticeable.</p>

<p>It also made me realize that I could get by with just a laptop. Syncing data between two computers is a bit of a pain, even with things like Dropbox and source control management. On more than one occasion I had to call my wife and walk her through performing an <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/a-tour-of-mercurial-the-basics.html#x_68"><code>hg push</code></a> in order to send me the latest bits of a project. I held on to this computer for a little while and then sold it to put together enough scratch for the next one.</p>

<p><strong>15&#8221; MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp620">(2011)</a> I went laptop only for the first time with this computer. It was my workhorse for almost 3 years. On it, I created Rails apps, iOS apps, and even managed to use it with my day job in .NET-land (through VMWare). It was reliable as a rock even with me mucking around inside it to upgrade the memory and hard drive. Even though I had this computer longer than most others, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot to say about it, which is a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>13&#8221; MacBook Pro w/Retina</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP691">(2014)</a> Here we are (finally) in the present. I didn&rsquo;t think the retina screen would be that much of a deal breaker, but I&rsquo;d rather sell my left foot than give it up now. I can leave my power cord at home and fit in an entire work day on the battery. Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s also crazy fast despite only having a dual-core CPU (my last one was a quad). All of that comes in a package just under 3.5 pounds. I&rsquo;ve only had this computer for a couple of months, but it&rsquo;s already the best one I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring. I like the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, but not enough to spring for its $3000+ price tag. And I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d go back to a desktop again. I&rsquo;d like to hold onto this laptop for as long as I can.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. Rails by itself runs fine on Windows. It&#8217;s when you start adding gems into the mix that things start going hinky. And then there&#8217;s the whole cygwin thing. Ugh.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Squarespace is a popular service to host a website or blog. You might have seen their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Or1f_RxKQ">Super Bowl commercial</a> or heard about them on one of the hundred podcasts they sponsor. I signed up about a year and a half ago and used it as my main blog. I&rsquo;ve decided to move away and use <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> to host my blog on <a href="http://octopress.org/">GitHub Pages</a> instead.</p>

<p>Why? Well, for starters, it&rsquo;s slow to use. I think it&rsquo;s a byproduct of the way they organized their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page application</a> architecture. I find myself having to wait for things to open in modal windows, or to load another menu.</p>

<p>The layout tools are bad. If all you do is write text and link to stuff, this doesn&rsquo;t matter. Sometimes I like to have <a href="/words/2014/01/26/demystifying-ruby-dsls">in depth coding posts</a> that have multiple blocks of code within them. This is incredibly painful to do with the Squarespace layout tools. Here&rsquo;s the process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hover over an existing text block.</li>
<li>Click the appropriate &ldquo;+&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Scroll down to find the &ldquo;CODE&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Paste in the code (after making sure the indentation is correct)</li>
<li>Go to step 1 and this time, select Markdown.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat for <em>every</em> block and image you want.</li>
</ol>


<p>What you see is <em>definitely not</em> what you get. Sizing images to align to the left or right of a paragraph is awful. For some reason, the editing font on the admin page is different than the one on the actual site. This means that even if everything lines up on the admin page, it might not on the live site. Fixing this is tedious. Again, due to the single-pagedness of the admin site, you can&rsquo;t easiliy open the preview in a new tab or window (&lsquo;Open in new page&rsquo; does nothing). You need to open a brand new browser window, navigate to your admin site, then click on the preview button there.</p>

<p>Saving a post in the editor closes the modal that contains it. This means that the workflow for making any kind of adjustment is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the thing above to get a second window open to look at the preview.</li>
<li>Click the post in the first window to edit.</li>
<li>Wait a second.</li>
<li>Find the typo to fix. This is extra fun if you have multiple blocks of text.</li>
<li>Fix the typo and hit save. (Modal closes)</li>
<li>Switch over to the preview in the second window and refresh.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s not right, repeat steps 2-6 until it is.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of this for about $100/year (or more).</p>

<p>Octopress is a static site generator that is aimed at developers. If you don&rsquo;t know <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, as well as HTML + CSS consider something else. However, since I am familiar with all of those, it works for me.</p>

<p>The problem is exporting my content from Squarespace. The only export option available is one for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, which dumps everything into an XML file. Since I&rsquo;m not using Wordpress, this didn&rsquo;t work for me. My blog has been quite the sojourner, created orginally on Wordpress, then to Posterous (lol), and finally Squarespace. It&rsquo;s accumulated a bit of cruft. For some reason, older posts did not export properly; if they contained an image and text, the text was deleted.</p>

<p>After some fiddling, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter">script</a> that would walk each post on the blog, download everything and then move onto the next. I did run into some gotchas though:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some of the older images were named &ldquo;#img.jpg&rdquo;. I ended up <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L151">generating</a> a random string for the filename and removing the hashtag.</li>
<li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags used a <code>data-src</code> attribute instead of a standard <code>src</code> attribute. <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L181">The fix was to rename the attribute</a>.</li>
<li>There was a veritable boatload of extra markup and attributes on each post, which made things look weird. I ended up parsing the entire HTML of each post and <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/squarespace-exporter/blob/master/script.rb#L223">stripping</a> out all the unnecessary stuff.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are still some issues that I&rsquo;ll need to address on a case by case basis, but it&rsquo;s a good 80% solution right now.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/assets/octopress.png" alt="Octopress" />
</figure>


<p>I like Octopress because it is fast, easy for me to manage, and keeps my content in a simple (and portable) format. I just hope that this will last me for a while. It doesn&rsquo;t do nearly as many things as Squarespace, but most of those I don&rsquo;t need.</p>
