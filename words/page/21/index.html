<p>Before I could actually use the fancier parts of <a href="http://www.krazyyak.com/category/tfs/" title="TFS Experience Blog">Visual Studio Team Foundation Server</a>, I had to first install it. I began by following this <a href="http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/04/04/2512.aspx" title="Vertigo Software TFS blog">Cliffs&#8217; Notes version of the process</a>, but changed up halfway through for reasons I&#8217;ll describe below.</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t have a spare machine around that was <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms400749(VS.80).aspx" title="TFS Server Requirements">beefy</a> enough to run TFS, but decided that it would be able to run fine in a Virtual Machine. According to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms400745(VS.80).aspx" title="TFS software requirements">this page</a>, TFS needs IIS, SQL Server 2005, and SharePoint Services all installed as prerequisites. Fortunately I happened to have a partially built VM lying around from when I thought I was going to be using SQL Reporting Services.  I had already installed SQL Server, just not with all of the components to go along with it. </p> <p>Setting up SharePoint was a little more obnoxious<sup><a href="#foot33">1</a></sup> than I remembered. Getting the stupid config database set up properly is a royal pain for someone who isn&#8217;t very familiar with the finer details of IIS and SQL Server. I could probably write a long rant about just that, but I&#8217;ll save it for another post&#8230;</p> <p>And of course, there are always snags&#8230; The default hard drive size for the VM was only 8 GB, too small for TFS to reliably use. The recommended minimum size is 10, so I increased it to 16 for good measure.</p> <p>Hilariously<sup><a href="#foot33">2</a></sup>, once I finally got all this done and started the actual TFS installer, it informed me that SharePoint was configured incorrectly and needed to be uninstalled, and then reinstalled again. At that point I just went to bed.</p> <p>Perhaps I should have heeded the warning in the Vertigo blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>And if there&#8217;s any question about any of this, don&#8217;t listen to me! I&#8217;m just Some Guy on the Internet(tm)! Refer to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40042">the official install guide</a>, man!</p>
</blockquote> <p>The next morning, I decided to go straight to the horse&#8217;s mouth and consulted the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E54BF6FF-026B-43A4-ADE4-A690388F310E&amp;displaylang=en" title="TFS Installation Guide download">manual</a> for any SharePoint advice. Apparently, I should have done this in the first place, because one of the how-to&#8217;s listed a simple command-line script to run to get everything set up properly:</p>
<div>
  <div><pre>stsv2.exe /C:"setupsts.exe /remoteSql=yes /provision=no /qn+"</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This took all of 5 seconds to run and install, then politely informed me that SharePoint was good to go. </p>
<p>Once again, I started to install TFS, and finally had success!  Lastly, I installed the Team Explorer client just to take a quick poke around. </p>
<p>That about covers the installation. I&#8217;ll start doing some basic functionality testing soon and then try to do some of the more advanced stuff.</p>

I think I have something to write about semi-regularly here. One of the major tasks for my job will be to streamline the build process for a couple of applications that are starting to wrap up their development. I have some experience using open source technology like <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a> and <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.net</a>, however this project uses Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx">Team Foundation Server</a> - which I have not used before.
</p>
<p>
So, as I bring myself up to speed here, I figured I&#8217;d blog about it.
</p>
<p>
First I&#8217;ll need to install the whole mess. My current MSDN Subscription does not have the full versions of TFS and the client tools, so I&#8217;ll be using the 180 day trial version (available for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D5C12289-F4E4-49A9-9235-AB2F6D4CA097&amp;displaylang=en">free here</a> if you feel like playing along at home). From what I gathered, installation is rather involved, so I expect this process to take most of the night. As for the client end, I&#8217;ll start with the plain old <a href="http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/05/22/2778.aspx">Team Explorer</a> plugin, and will probably upgrade to <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718822.aspx">Team Suite</a>&#8217;s trial as needed.

<p>Apparently, the cat is out of the bag. Certain <a href="http://www.maltastar.com/pages/msFullArt.asp?an=14323">Wikipedia articles may be edited by people to include their own bias</a>! Amazing, I know. However, this news does not really change my opinion of wikipedia. I still think it is a fantastic resource and incredibly useful when I need to get the basic gist of some random topic that grabs my interest.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately for me, I have the luxury of not having to do any sort of research that requires concrete evidence. In other words, I am not a student with a paper due. However, the idea that the stuff I read may not be entirely kosher is a little worrisome. There is a relatively simple solution though: references. A good wikipedia article cites the sources of the &#8220;facts&#8221; it portrays.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
What I gain from this is that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Ball" title="Q-Ball">article</a> in question is probably pretty sound. And if I still feel that something is fishy, I can actually look those references up(!). Additionally, I can verify that the sources are not just some guy&#8217;s blog that could be as potentially inaccurate as the wikipedia article.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, <strong>do not</strong> use wikipedia as your sole source of information, but <strong>do</strong> use it as a springboard to find the real dirt.

<p>Before I <a href="http://www.krazyyak.com/2007/08/08/a-change/">turned in my resignation</a> I had been considering seeking new employment for a while. One of the biggest barriers that kept me from diving in sooner was that it is such a pain to find a new job. Aside from having to switch over insurance companies, retirement accounts, etc. there&#8217;s the whole searching business which can just be annoying.</p>
<p>And then I realized that the process of finding a job is very similar to the dating game. You have &#8220;friends&#8221; that can hook you up with a &#8220;nice&#8221; gig (&#8220;they have a great personality!&#8221;), <a href="http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/">personals</a>, and <a href="http://www.azdes.gov/esa/events.asp" title="Job Fairs">meat markets</a>. Heck, you even have pimps (some may call them <em>contractors</em>).</p>
<p>In the dating world, some companies have realized just how hit and miss most of those are and started evaluating personality. I personally have never used a place like <a href="http://www.eharmony.com">eharmony</a>, but I am familiar with the psychology behind their processes.<sup><a href="#27_1">1</a></sup> And, apparently they have had a pretty <a href="http://www.eharmony.com/static/newsletter/volume36.htm">decent success rate</a>.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if the same thing could work in the job market. What if one of the larger job sites like <a href="http://www.dice.com">dice.com</a> listed not only the job requirements, but also had a candidate fill out a basic personality profile? Yes, people could just lie on the profile, but they can already do that their resumes too. It would make me feel a little more comfortable going in to a new situation knowing that I was going to fit in with my co-workers.</p>

Well, I&#8217;m off on another new job adventure! I just turned in my resignation to my current employer and will be starting my new role in a couple of weeks with <a href="http://www.sogeti.com">Sogeti</a>. I won&#8217;t go into the sordid details of why I&#8217;m leaving, but will say that the primary reason is that I feel I&#8217;ve reached the limit of where my current employer can take me career-wise.
</p>
<p>
My job will be a kind of blend between the stable world of salary-based pay, and contract-like change of scenery. Sogeti consults for many large clients and sends small teams of developers to either develop solutions or augment existing teams.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#8217;m a little nervous, but also excited. I hope this works out.

		<div><div><div><div><div>In the past, I have been rather unkind to open source projects. Some of my criticisms may not have been valid, but one thing that I feel still holds is my beef with the &#8220;user experience.&#8221; I use quotes because that expression sounds an awful lot like marketing-speak, which I try to avoid, but can&#8217;t think of a better term.

What I mean is that it is an all too common trend in open source projects to put forth a titanic effort to code the software, but an abysmal one to make it user friendly and to document it well.

Just recently, I needed to implement some form of complicated logging in an application I was tasked with. Most suggestions on the web pointed to the open source library <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/" title="log4net homepage">log4net</a>. Those recommendations did come with a word of warning though that it was a little heady to jump right into. But, since time was of the essence, I threw myself off from the high dive and into the deep-end.

Those guys were right.

Log4net is a very robust and extensible logging framework, and it performs well, but it took me the better part of a day and a half to figure out how have it write to Oracle and properly extend the formatters to my fit my will. The documentation is what we in the industry call &#8220;sparse.&#8221; It provides some very basic examples and then just chucks the API at you and throws you to the wolves.

Contrast that with something like <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="SubVersion homepage">SubVersion</a>. SubVersion may not be the greatest Source Control Provider out there, but it has <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" title="Tortoise">TortoiseSVN</a>. The Tortoise UI makes managing a repository of code brain dead simple; even a non-programmer(!) could do it. Installation is easy: a typical windows installer package that requires the standard amount of clicks to get up and running. The app itself is built right into the Windows shell; just right-click and there you are!

Perhaps most importantly though, the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">documentation</a><a href="#21_1"><sup>1</sup></a> was up to snuff. No, more than that, it was superb! It sounded like a <em>real</em> human being wrote it, not a coder! I actually wanted to read the thing. Additionally I learned a thing or two about code management in general, not just pertaining to SubVersion.

I&#8217;d bet that one of the reasons SubVersion is so popular is because it manages to hold the user&#8217;s hand without treating him like a child. From what I can tell, <a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="Git homepage">git</a> is a pretty powerful competitor to SubVersion, but until it has as nice an interface as Tortoise, it will never see as high of an adoption.

I would argue that the single greatest hurdle that the open source movement still needs to overcome is the notion that their audience is not just the geeky programmers huddled up in their caves. It is a tricky line to walk though, too much hand-holding is just as big of a product killer as too little.
<div> <a></a>1.  This may not be the fairest comparisons, the &#8220;documentation&#8221; for SubVersion was originally published as a real book by O&#8217;Reilly. However, my underlying point about documentation still stands. <a href="#21_1_orig">Â«</a>

		<div><div><div><div><div>I enjoy photography, and I think I&#8217;ve been slowly getting better at it.Â However,Â I have felt like I&#8217;ve just been a rut for the longest time. I do think that part of it is simply laziness brought on by the fact that I don&#8217;t have much motivation to get out of the air conditioning when it&#8217;s 110+ outside.

So, I&#8217;m going to try to suck it up and actually go out to some of the &#8220;sites&#8221; around Phoenix. I&#8217;ll probably be doing this on weekends, and if anyone would care to join me, I&#8217;d love to have you.

I&#8217;ll be visiting:
<ul>
<li>Papago Park, specifically the Hole-in-the-rock. This weekend.</li>
	<li>Desert Botanical Gardens. This is mostly because my brother-in-law is getting married here next year and I will be doing the pictures, so I&#8217;d like to scout out the area.</li>
	<li>The Phoenix Zoo. I was never too fond of zoos when I was a kid, maybe I&#8217;ll like them more now.</li>
	<li>Camelback Mountain.</li>
	<li>Pinnacle Peak. I have a friend who goes out rock climbing here from time to time, I&#8217;d like to catch some of that in action.</li>
	<li>The Superstition Mountains. There are tons of trails all around here, by the time I get around to this, it should be cool enough to get some quality hiking.</li>
	<li>Four Peaks.</li>
	<li>Downtown Phoenix and the Biltmore area, for architectural stuff.</li>
</ul>
At some point I&#8217;d like to take more extended trips up through northern Arizona, and hit various places in the Mogollon Rim, and the various canyons.

Does anyone else have some good ideas for places that lend themselves well to photography?Â </div></div></div></div></div>
