		<div><div><div><div><div>I&#8217;m kind of on the fence with Facebook. On the one hand, it let&#8217;s me share news, pictures, and information very easily with friends and family. On the other, it&#8217;s run by people who are either incompetent or outright malicious with their practices. Just read a couple of these articles to find out just how they feel about your data (some articles contain R-rated language, mom):<div> <ul>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5">Business Insider</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-has-recently-been-displaying-a-disregard-bordering-on-disdain-for-facebook-users-privacy-2010-5">More Business Insider</a> </li> <li>
<a href="http://calacanis.com/2010/05/12/the-big-game-zuckerberg-and-overplaying-your-hand/">Jason Calacanis</a> (whom I normally can&#8217;t stand, but offers insightful information here)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline">The EFF</a> on their slowly eroding privacy policy.</li> </ul>
</div>
<div>This stuff seems pretty bad, especially the cavalier attitude their CEO has with regards to privacy. The crazy part is: they do not have any reason to change. Over 35 million people check their Facebook pages at least once a day (I&#8217;m one of them). So unless they take a significant hit in the pocketbook, why would they change?</div> <p></p>
<div>I&#8217;m not calling for a boycott here, that&#8217;s just a little silly. And Facebook does still provide a useful utility; there just isn&#8217;t a better way for me to keep up with my circle of friends out there. However, I am careful with what is on my Facebook. I don&#8217;t install any apps or games, I monitor my privacy settings every little while or so, and I don&#8217;t use status updates for anything serious.<br><p></p>
<div>So use Facebook, and have fun, but exercise some caution. Do not post <i><b>anything</b></i> on it that you wouldn&#8217;t mind having shouted from a megaphone to the entire planet. </div>

		<div><div><div><div><div>As you may remember, a few weeks ago Avis gave me a <a href="/images/assets/1269992699000.jpg">FORD LAND TANK</a>. I didn&#8217;t enjoy driving it, so when I returned it, I told them that while I&#8217;m open to the idea of them upgrading my mid-size rental, I&#8217;d prefer something other than a gigantic truck.<p></p>
<div>Cut to Sunday night as I wandered over to the parking spot that contained my car for this week. Behold, it contained&#8230; another F150. <i>sigh</i>. I trudged back over to the rental counter and explained to the nice chap explained the whole thing again. I just didn&#8217;t want something that would be featured in a Cialis ad.</div> <p></p>
<div>The Avis employee was effusively gracious, apologized to me, and looked through his computer for an adequate substitute. I was expecting to be banished back to the realm of Hyundai econoboxes, when he said, &#8220;Let me see if I can get you into one of our Infinitis.&#8221;</div> <p></p>
<div>Cool.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I stared at him for a couple of moments and eventually managed, &#8220;Yes. That would be nice.&#8221; </div>
<p></p>
<div>So that&#8217;s how I got to spend the next couple of days driving around in a nice little <a href="http://www.infinitiusa.com/g_sedan/">G37 sedan</a>. It&#8217;s um, a little faster than what I&#8217;ve been used to from my rental cars.</div>

		<div><div><div><div><div>Or, the waiting is the hardest part&#8230;<p></p>
<div>Flying anywhere requires quite a bit of sitting around and waiting. This is why I am not the most pleasant person on travel days. Here&#8217;s how I get to Dallas:</div> <div>
<ul>
<li>Leave the house at about 4pm to get to the airport early enough.</li>
<li>Park in the garage, walk to bus stop.</li>
<li>
<b>Wait</b> for the shuttle to the terminal.</li>
<li>Get on bus, ride to terminal.</li>
<li> <b>Wait</b> in line at security.</li>
<li>Talk to the nice TSA screener. Show ID and boarding pass. Go to the metal detectors.</li>
<li>
<b>Wait </b>for the person in front of me who has obviously never been on a plane before. Yes, she did just send their water bottle and laptop through the scanner still in her bag. I wonder if she&#8217;s still wearing her shoes too? Bingo.</li> <li>Go through security, find terminal, sit and <b>wait<i> </i><span>for boarding.</span></b>
</li>
<li><b><span>Boarding zone is called, walk towards plane.</span></b></li> <li>
<b>Wait</b> to get in seat because some knucklehead is taking 5 minutes to stuff his oversized carry-on in the bin, then takes off his jacket and tries to stuff it up there too.</li>
<li>Get in seat. <b>Wait</b> for rest of plane to board. Knucklehead&#8217;s family is apparently flying with him too and holds up the line even more.</li> <li>Plane boarded, and doors close, <b>wait</b> for plane to pull away from terminal and go to runway.</li>
<li>Finally up in the air. Watch movies on iPod. This is sort of like waiting, but in an uncomfortable seat with little to no legroom. So it&#8217;s totally different!</li> <li>Land in Dallas. <b>Wait</b> for plane to taxi to terminal, which is apparently a mile away.</li>
<li>Seriously, are we circling the airport on the ground? I can walk faster than this.</li>
<li>Reach gate. Doors open. <b>Wait </b>for people to get their stuff down from the bins. Again, this seems to be a very involved process for some. I tend to be the kind of person who reaches up to the handle, pulls it down and walks out. But that&#8217;s just me.</li> <li>Walk to rental car shuttle pickup. <b>Wait</b> for shuttle. I&#8217;ve exhausted my <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams">twitter</a> and facebook info on my <a href="swilliams">phone</a> by now and am getting antsy.</li> <li>Get on shuttle, drive to rental car center.</li>
<li>Get rental car, drive to hotel.</li>
<li>
<b>Wait</b> for night management to open the front door since they lock it at 11pm. </li>
<li>It is now about midnight and I&#8217;m finally in my room.</li> </ul>
<div>That&#8217;s a lot of waiting. After about the 7th or 8th &#8220;wait&#8221; up there I&#8217;m about ready to snap and start choking people. The most annoying issue I have with this is that there just isn&#8217;t that much I can do to make things run any smoother. I <i>could </i>get to the airport a little later, but then I run the risk of missing my flight altogether if something goes wrong, or the TSA line is abnormally long.</div> <p></p>
<div>I&#8217;ve since started traveling 100% carry-on bags, since waiting to check luggage, and then waiting for it to be regurgitated by the airline, is just more time to be frustrated. Fortunately, my company has switched to using Avis for rental cars, so I can just walk by their desk, see my name and car on a big board, and head straight to it with the keys waiting for me.</div> <p></p>
<div>I will be glad when this stint ends in a few weeks, if only because my brain will appreciate not having to actively fight a complete shutdown due to all the waiting.</div>

<time datetime="2010-03-29T00:00:00-07:00" data-updated="true" itemprop="datePublished">Mar 29<span>th</span>, 2010</time></div>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<div><div><div><div><div>Something that I&#8217;ve noticed in certain photographic forums is a bit of a snobbery when it comes to the preferred mode a person&#8217;s camera is in. There seems to be a prevailing notion that Manual is the One True Mode for a camera, and everything else is for &#8220;noobs&#8221;.<p></p>
<div>I used to feel this way, but in my own recent work, I have started to use Aperture priority and even Auto-ISO more and more, and have been incredibly happy with the results. In fact, when I&#8217;m not shooting with flash, or in dim lighting, In fact, you could state that I&#8217;m getting close to using the easy settings all of the time.</div> <p></p>
<div>I will make this claim though: if you are a <b>beginner-</b> <a href="/images/assets/1250761860000.jpg">if you just dropped $799</a> on a new DSLR and don&#8217;t know what you are doing, you would benefit much more by sticking with Manual mode. Manual forces you to learn the relationship between ISO and Aperture and Shutter. It really makes you really think before pressing the button. I&#8217;ve said before, if you don&#8217;t want to know this stuff, then all you have is an expensive point and shoot camera with removable lenses.</div> <p></p>
<div>Further, most entry level cameras will lack sophisticated technology that makes the other modes more attractive. My first camera, the Nikon D50, only had five auto-focus points, and a sort of bad matrix metering system. I kept it set on Manual most of the time and spot metered my exposure manually too.</div> <p></p>
<div>These days, I&#8217;m not a rank beginner anymore<span>1</span>. Now, I shoot with a Nikon D300. The auto-focus and metering system on that thing are <i>awesome </i>(and they should be considering the price). The camera is incredibly adept at figuring out a good exposure when kept on matrix metering. And in the 1% of the time it cannot, I have a custom function button that puts it into spot metering when it is held down.</div> <p></p>
<div>Using Aperture priority mode does not mean I have no control over anything else either. By default any non-manual setting will aim at an even, middle of the road exposure. But, with the twist of a dial I can tell it to go brighter or darker. I typically range it from +.3 to +1.0 to <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">expose to the right</a>.</div> <p></p>
<div>Most recently, I&#8217;ve been using Auto-ISO as well. This was pretty limited on my D50, and I imagine this is still the case on newer amateur oriented cameras as well. But, on the D300, this works swimmingly because it can be configured in detail. I can set the minimum shutter speed I want to use, and tell it to not go higher than ISO 1600. Thus when it is detecting that I&#8217;m not getting the shutter speed I need, it bumps the ISO up just a little bit. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see an ISO of something like 250 or 900 in this range. </div> <p></p>
<div>With these settings I can pull the camera up to my eye and start shooting immediately in most situations. And yes, if I need to really fine tune an image, I can still quickly jump to M mode and tweak away.</div> <p></p>

<div>I tried not to jump up and down like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079367/" title="The new phonebooks are here!" style="color: #551a8b;">Navin Johnson</a> when the day arrived, but it was time to get a new phone<span>book</span>! I love my technological toys, and I love getting new ones even more. The role of the phone itself has evolved into something much more important in my life. It is probably the second most used piece of electronics I own, just behind my computer, so it needs to be a good one.
