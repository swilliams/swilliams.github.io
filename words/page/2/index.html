		<p>Recently, <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/greenwald/">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Poitras">Laura Poitras</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> took part in an <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/iama">&lsquo;IAMA&rsquo;</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn">converstation on Reddit</a>. It&rsquo;s a long one, and somewhere down the page, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/coup7ld">this question was asked</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What&rsquo;s the best way to make NSA spying an issue in the 2016 Presidential Election? It seems like while it was a big deal in 2013, ISIS and other events have put it on the back burner for now in the media and general public. What are your ideas for how to bring it back to the forefront?</p></blockquote>

<p>Funny how this seems to happen. Snowden gave a tremendous answer. There&rsquo;s too many great quotes to pull from his response, so I&rsquo;ll just copy/paste the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/courx1i">whole thing</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a good question, and there are some good traditional answers here. Organizing is important. Activism is important.</p>

<p>At the same time, we should remember that governments don&rsquo;t often reform themselves. One of the arguments in a book I read recently (Bruce Schneier, &ldquo;Data and Goliath&rdquo;), is that perfect enforcement of the law sounds like a good thing, but that may not always be the case. The end of crime sounds pretty compelling, right, so how can that be?</p>

<p>Well, when we look back on history, the progress of Western civilization and human rights is actually founded on the violation of law. America was of course born out of a violent revolution that was an outrageous treason against the crown and established order of the day. History shows that the righting of historical wrongs is often born from acts of unrepentant criminality. Slavery. The protection of persecuted Jews.</p>

<p>But even on less extremist topics, we can find similar examples. How about the prohibition of alcohol? Gay marriage? Marijuana?</p>

<p>Where would we be today if the government, enjoying powers of perfect surveillance and enforcement, had &mdash; entirely within the law &mdash; rounded up, imprisoned, and shamed all of these lawbreakers?</p>

<p>Ultimately, if people lose their willingness to recognize that there are times in our history when legality becomes distinct from morality, we aren&rsquo;t just ceding control of our rights to government, but our agency in determing thour futures.</p>

<p>How does this relate to politics? Well, I suspect that governments today are more concerned with the loss of their ability to control and regulate the behavior of their citizens than they are with their citizens&#8217; discontent.</p>

<p>How do we make that work for us? We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights.</p>

<p>You can see the beginnings of this dynamic today in the statements of government officials complaining about the adoption of encryption by major technology providers. The idea here isn&rsquo;t to fling ourselves into anarchy and do away with government, but to remind the government that there must always be a balance of power between the governing and the governed, and that as the progress of science increasingly empowers communities and individuals, there will be more and more areas of our lives where &mdash; if government insists on behaving poorly and with a callous disregard for the citizen &mdash; we can find ways to reduce or remove their powers on a new &mdash; and permanent &mdash; basis.</p>

<p>Our rights are not granted by governments. They are inherent to our nature. But it&rsquo;s entirely the opposite for governments: their privileges are precisely equal to only those which we suffer them to enjoy.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t had to think about that much in the last few decades because quality of life has been increasing across almost all measures in a significant way, and that has led to a comfortable complacency. But here and there throughout history, we&rsquo;ll occasionally come across these periods where governments think more about what they &ldquo;can&rdquo; do rather than what they &ldquo;should&rdquo; do, and what is lawful will become increasingly distinct from what is moral.</p>

<p>In such times, we&rsquo;d do well to remember that at the end of the day, the law doesn&rsquo;t defend us; we defend the law. And when it becomes contrary to our morals, we have both the right and the responsibility to rebalance it toward just ends.</p></blockquote>

		<p>You should listen to <a href="http://www.relay.fm/">Relay.fm&rsquo;s</a> new series on Inquisitive, <a href="http://www.relay.fm/inquisitive/27">&ldquo;Behind the App&rdquo;</a>. Myke opens the show with how the iPhone (and smartphones in general) helped bring podcasts to a larger audience. He&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>

<p>Before smartphones, you had to sync everything to an iPod with your computer before you could listen to it. For me, this usually happened at home, and if I forgot to plug in my iPod and sync it, I&rsquo;d go without new episodes for the day; a fate worse than death. Syncing an iPod at the office was usually out of the question. IT policy at the time disallowed connecting personal hardware to company PCs <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and blacklisted many of the sites hosting the audio files anyway.</p>

<p>I could live with the first issue, but I would go to great lengths to work around the latter one. Even though the experience wasn&rsquo;t as nice, downloading and listening to a podcast on my work PC was still something. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSH into my Linux based web server</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Overview"><code>wget</code></a> the RSS feed</li>
<li>Find the link to the newest mp3 file</li>
<li><code>wget</code> the mp3</li>
<li>Copy it into a folder publicly accessible on my server (this wasn&rsquo;t blocked by IT)</li>
<li>Download it locally with my web browser (this was Windows and installing something like wget was also strictly verboten from IT)</li>
<li>Listen</li>
</ul>


<p>Easy peesy lemon squeezey, right?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Now, if I want to listen to a podcast, I open up <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> and see if there&rsquo;s anything new. The only thing I have to think about now if I want to download over my cellular connection or not.</p>

<p>The future is good.</p>

Then, I&#8217;ll reposition the transmitter dish on the remote truck to 17.32 degrees east, hit WESTAR 4 over the Atlantic, bounce the signal down into the Azores, up to COMSAT 6, beam it back to SATCOM 2 transmitter number 137, and down on the dish on the back of Mr. Big&#8217;s limo&#8230; It&#8217;s almost too easy.&#8221; — <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793/">Garth Algar</a></p>

		<p>When listening to a podcast, the host will often forget a word or well known fact. Maybe they&rsquo;ll say something silly like <a href="http://on.cc.com/1rU1N7O">&ldquo;Jedi mind meld&rdquo;</a>. Everyone in the audience knows exactly what they meant, and everyone will likely make that fact known (I&rsquo;ve sure been there, and will likely continue to be).</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve released a few episodes of <a href="http://www.fronttoback.co/">my own podcast</a> I&rsquo;ve seen the other side of the microphone. Talking and thinking at the same time is surprisingly difficult after say, 8 words in. I&rsquo;ll find myself stumbling over witty quips and forgetting familiar things that had been otherwise seared into my memory.</p>

<p>So, I have a teensy bit more empathy for Pete Carroll the day after <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/super-bowl-new-england-patriots-seattle-seahawks/">an impressive Super Bowl Loss</a>. Yeah, he probably should&rsquo;ve run Marshawn Lynch on that one play, but I don&rsquo;t know if I would&rsquo;ve had the brain power to make a different decision with under 30 seconds left, in the 4th quarter, of the Super Bowl.</p>

<h3>Better Know a Jackal</h3>

<p>The [rabid] fans of the 5by5 podcast network are informally known as &ldquo;Jackals&rdquo;. One of said Jackals, <a href="http://twitter.com/mikebeasterfeld">Mike Beasterfeld</a> had the brilliant idea to create a <a href="http://www.jackals.us/better-know-a-jackal">podcast to interview us</a>. I made it onto <a href="http://www.jackals.us/better-know-a-jackal/28">episode 28</a>. It&rsquo;s a nice little bio that you can use to gather information to steal my identity.</p>

<h3>Less Than Or Equal</h3>

<p>I was a guest on episode 25 of <a href="http://twitter.com/aleen">Aleen Simms&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.lessthanorequal.com/episodes/25">Less Than Or Equal</a> podcast. I had a great time talking with her and we chatted about maturity, growing up, and how having daughters changed me; specifically some specific incidents in my personal history that formed me into what I am today. Speaking of daughters&hellip;</p>

<h3>Front to Back</h3>

<p>We just released our <a href="http://www.fronttoback.co/podcast/2015/1/27/6-practice-kid">6th(!) episode</a>. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed making this show and have learned more and more about audio editing. This time around I used some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">compression</a> to make our voices sound better.</p>

<p>Please check them out!</p>

		<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us">Surface</a> was never the barnburner that Microsoft hoped it would be. People have been <a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140629/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/microsoft-discontinue-surface-tablet">predicting</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/surface-2-prices-slashed-hinting-at-discontinuation-or-replacement/">its demise</a> for the <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/10/09/microsoft-surface-pro-3/">last year</a>. It&rsquo;s suffered from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyTxiTKxgI">goofy advertising</a> and lately seems to be begging the masses to please think of it instead of an iPad, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jP4O7rEHQ8">anything but an iPad, oh please</a>! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m certainly no Don Draper, but that&rsquo;s not gonna prevent my <del>ego</del> imagination to think of how I&rsquo;d do it instead. The idea is that the Surface apparently has a nice stylus/pen that can be used by artists. Penny Arcarde&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2013/10/28/surface-pro-2">Mike Krahulik has been a fan</a> and used them to draw their popular web comic. That&rsquo;s your angle right there. Now, not many people are artists that would benefit from a refined drawing interface, but plenty of people <em>fancy</em> themselves as such. Nike convinced you that sneakers with compressed air in them would make you Michael Jordan, why isn&rsquo;t Microsoft showing you that Surface would make you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lee">Jim Lee</a>?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your commercial: Camera fades in to reveal someone intently working on a Surface. They&rsquo;re sitting in a comfy chair, or on a couch, or some kind of hipster furniture. We don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s on the screen yet but we can see them concentrating and cranking away at <em>something</em> with the pen. Cut to the over-the-shoulder shot. We now see a painting/sketch/comic coming to life.</p>

<p>Cut to closeups of the pen drawing right on the glass. There&rsquo;s no lag. The pen is able to draw with a fine point. There&rsquo;s obvious pressure sensitivity. (Things you pretty much can&rsquo;t do on an iPad, but without calling it by name.) They put the pen down and &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; things with their finger.</p>

<p>Finally the art is done. The artist switches to their website and immediately publishes the work.</p>

<p>Cut to a desk with the notorious Surface keyboard and a wireless mouse right next to it. The Surface clicks in to the keyboard, sits up on the kickstand and a modern 3D PC game (say, Far Cry 4) starts up (oh yeah, it&rsquo;s got an i5 and a GPU). Display the tagline: &ldquo;Make. Publish. Play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be more interesting than breakdancing? Wouldn&rsquo;t that get you pumped up just a little bit? These days I&rsquo;m a Microsoft cynic, and that would at least get me to raise an eyebrow and <em>wish</em> my iPad could do something like that.</p>

<p>If Apple is in fact <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/18/kgi-apple-likely-to-sell-stylus-accessory-alongside-12-inch-ipad-pro/">working on a stylus</a> that avenue will probably close.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li class="footnote" id="fn:1">
  <p>The funny thing is that out of all Apple&#8217;s products, the iPad is the one that has plateaued the most. Why are you aiming at that one?</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take a common scenario. You are making an HTTP request and are checking the response for an error. If there is one, you&rsquo;d like to post a notification and let some error handler deal with it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>    Alamofire.request(.GET, someURL).response { (request, response, data, error) in
</span><span class='line'>        if error != nil {
</span><span class='line'>            let userInfo = ["error": error]
</span><span class='line'>            let nc = NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter()
</span><span class='line'>            nc.postNotificationName("HTTPERROR", object: nil, userInfo: userInfo)
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>    }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Uh oh, there&rsquo;s a compiler error on the <code>userInfo</code> argument with the message &ldquo;Extra argument &lsquo;userInfo&rsquo; in call&rdquo;. Huh? <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSNotificationCenter_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSNotificationCenter/postNotificationName:object:userInfo:"><code>postNotificationName</code> definitely allows for a <code>userInfo</code> parameter</a>. Maybe it&rsquo;s a hidden typing error? According to the docs <code>userInfo</code> is supposed to be an optional dictionary like of type: <code>[NSObject : AnyObject]</code>. My key is a String which is bridged from <code>NSString</code>, which is an <code>NSObject</code> and <code>NSError</code> is also an <code>AnyObject</code>, so what gives?</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img alt="Lying" src="/images/assets/xcode-lying-cat.jpg">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>After banging my head on the wall for a while I remembered that the <code>error</code> variable from <a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire">AlamoFire</a> is an optional. Therefore, the correct declaration for <code>userInfo</code> is to unwrap the error:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>let userInfo = ["error": error!]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And voilà, no more compilation errors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extra argument &lsquo;userInfo&rsquo; in call&rdquo; is a crappy error message. The proper one should have been something about values in the <code>userInfo</code> dictionary not being optional.</p>

<p>Swift is full of these unfortunately. Between these and your friendly SourceKit crashes it&rsquo;s getting untenable. My wish for 2015 is for Apple to address these shortcomings.</p>

So that the juice within you flows<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Thy rawness shall be ending<br /></p>

<p>O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Such gravy will you make me!<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />

<p>The thermometer will pierce your side<br />
Until your temp reads 125<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Such gravy will you make me!<br /></p>

<p>O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
We&rsquo;ll set our teeth upon thee!<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />

<p>Two yards of plastic will we turn<br />
To avoid a chilling freezer burn<br />
O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
We&rsquo;ll save you for another meal<br /></p>

<p>Each tasty bite<br />
Each dab of meat<br />
No other bite will fill my cheeks<br /></p>

<p>O Christmas Roast, O Christmas Roast!<br />
Within our guts digesting<br />
Within our guts digesting<br /></p>

		<p>We just published episode 2 of <a href="https://scott-williams-bc50.squarespace.com/podcast/2014/12/3/2-the-proliferation-of-duplo">the podcast</a>. I&rsquo;m still very new at this, but I&rsquo;ve already learned more than I anticipated. Most of these are forehead slappers that now you can avoid when you make your podcast.</p>

<p>If you want to do a <a href="http://thepodcastersstudio.com/tps-ep-47-recording-a-double-ender-podcast/">double-ender</a>, don&rsquo;t use Quicktime&rsquo;s built-in audio recording &ndash; it smushes all the audio into a single track. <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Ecamm Call Recorder</a> or <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/">Piezo</a> will keep them separate.</p>

<p>Have each person say something like &ldquo;Recording&rdquo; when they start recording their end of the call. This makes it orders of magnitude easier to line up the separate audio tracks during post production. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Plug your headphones directly into your microphone. Doing something else will likely lead to some nasty <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/12/02/how-to-add-a-noise-gate-in-garageband-10/">headphone bleed</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Yeti-USB-Microphone/dp/B002VA464S/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=blue%2Byeti&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;qid=1417634348">Blue Yeti</a>, switch to Cardioid mode. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; or &ldquo;pacman&rdquo; symbol. Turn the gain down on it too.</p>

<p>You need to <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html">submit your podcast feed to Apple</a> if you want your podcast to be in iTunes (and you really want that). According to their <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/creatorfaq.html">FAQ</a> it can take 24 hours for that feed to be approved. But if you submit your feed on a common US holiday week, like say the Monday before Thanksgiving, it might take significantly longer.</p>

<p>If you have something pre-made you want to say on air, write it down first because your brain will simply refuse to cooperate if you try to just remember it.</p>

</figure>


<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/fight-over-flickrs-use-of-photos-1416875564">Recently, Flickr started to sell photos uploaded by its users marked with the Creative Commons license that allows commercial use</a>. They&rsquo;ve taken <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/11/29/flickr-is-about-to-sell-off-your-creative-commons-photos/">some</a> <a href="http://jensimmons.com/writing/i-dont-want-creative-commons-by-to-mean-you-can-rip-me-off">heat</a> for this. I understand being angry about this sudden change without much notification, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s terribly suprising that they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>

<p>The Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">license grants them plenty of rights</a>. It says in plain english, &ldquo;&hellip;copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
for any purpose, even commercially&hellip; No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I used this license for the icon in <a href="http://emergencycontacts.org/">Emergency Contacts</a>. The <a href="http://thenounproject.com/term/siren/16374/">siren in it</a> was created by <a href="http://thenounproject.com/canabravatorres/">Daniel Canabrava Torres</a> and I found it by searching <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>. I attributed him on the website and in the app, and did not pay him for it. I&rsquo;ve also used it to find photos for on this blog, like the one up top.</p>

<p>What else does that license mean? Almost anything.</p>

<p>It means that Coca-Cola could take your photo, make it part of a national campaign, put in on every billboard in the US, and not pay you a nickel. It means that Better Homes And Gardens with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_magazines_by_circulation#United_States">7.5 million subscribers</a> could put your photo on the cover, and not pay you anything. It means that I could scrape Flickr and sell your photos myself, and keep all the revenues. As long as you are &ldquo;attributed&rdquo; in some way, it&rsquo;s all legal.</p>

<p>Flickr requires you to set some kind of license when you upload a photo. By <em>default</em> uses the most restrictive: &ldquo;All rights reserved&rdquo; (which precludes anyone but you from selling them), making the Creative Commons option <strong>opt-in</strong>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> You also have the opportunity to set a license on every photo when you upload it.</p>

<p>What about other websites? Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">Facebook&rsquo;s terms</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511">Instagram</a> is nearly identical (no surprise considering they are owned by Facebook):</p>

<blockquote><p>Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, available here <a href="http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/,">http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/,</a> including but not limited to sections 3 (&ldquo;Sharing of Your Information&rdquo;), 4 (&ldquo;How We Store Your Information&rdquo;), and 5 (&ldquo;Your Choices About Your Information&rdquo;). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tos">Twitter</a> has similar terms too:</p>

<blockquote><p>You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>

<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use.</p>

<p>Such additional uses by Twitter, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.</p>

<p>We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p></blockquote>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get any options when you share a photo on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. This is far worse. The language is loose enough that it grants them to do just about anything. If they want to sell it, they can, and keep all the proceeds.</p>

<p>In my opinion, all of these websites should make it clear what they are allowed to do with your photos, when you upload them. Right now, it&rsquo;s too obscured, and users probably aren&rsquo;t even aware of this.</p>

<p>If you really want control, and to maintain the licensing rights<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> of your photos on the Internet, you have to host them all yourself. That kind of sucks, but it is the cost of the &ldquo;social&rdquo; Internet.</p>

  <p>Note that there is absolutely nothing you can do to keep someone else from grabbing your photo and uploading it to some other place and claim ownership. I mean you could sue them, but that&#8217;s using a grenade to kill a housefly.</p>
