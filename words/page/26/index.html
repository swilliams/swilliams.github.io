<p><em>This is reprinted here for posterity from the <a href="http://dominican2009.com/2009/07/02/so-how-close-was-it-anyway/">original post</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Most people I’ve talked with have seemed interested in hearing about the fateful “flood hike” as we call it. I will try to recount the details here. I think I am remembering things correctly, but if if I miss a detail, please let me know. And for the parents, the purpose of this post isn’t to frighten or incite worry, but to tell the story. –Scott<br></em></p>
<p>Sunday was bright and sunny, and we had quite a wonderful and eye opening experience at the local church service that morning. After lunch, the skies clouded up, and we had a little rain, which was normal on the trip thus far. We strapped on our hiking gear and waited for the All Clear from the Camp Director, Roy.</p>
<p>Eventually, Roy gathered us together and gave us a brief overview of the hike. There was a smaller 15 foot waterfall pretty close to camp; about 25 or so minutes away. But, another 40 minutes beyond that one was a spectacular 50 footer that was worth the effort to get to. “Oh and in the event of a flash flood, do not run, get to higher ground,” Roy said, “but I haven’t seen one of those in my 10 years here.”</p>
<p>With that admonition, we headed out! The hike was spectacular. There was foliage growing all throughout the paths, and at times it felt like it was a dark tropical rainforest, no beams of sunlight penetrated the tree cover. I made the decision to leave my camera in my bag in the interest of getting to our destination quickly. My rationalization was that I could always take shots on the way back out.</p>
<p>We hiked up a hill and then down the other side of it into the ravine with the river. The path followed the river the rest of the way, and we were in full view of the first waterfall before long. I did manage to pull my camera out and snap some shots of it and the rapids that poured over the surrounding rocks. <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com/dispatch.fcgi/galleries/DR2009/index_12.html" title="View Pictures" target="_blank">(View First Waterfall Pictures)</a></p>
<p>A smaller group of about 10 or so people stayed at the first fall, and the rest of us (roughly 20) climbed up the rock and continued onward. The path this time crossed over the river and then back again a few times. Water was usually up to my ankles at these parts, and nipped at my thighs occasionally in the deepest parts.</p>
<p>Somewhere near the halfway point between the waterfalls, it started raining harder. The skies were more darkened at this point. I took my last pictures here and returned my camera to my backpack, confident that the weather proofing would keep the water out. I did make a joke about it looking like the Smoke Monster from Lost was about to attack.</p>
<p>At last we arrived at the big waterfall, and Roy was right, it was totally worth the extra hike. Water streamed down from the heavens into a small pool. There were just enough footholds to get about 20 feet up, jump in, and swim out and do it all over again. Had the sun been out, we could have easily spent hours there.</p>
<p>However, it was already afternoon and the rain wasn’t looking like it was going to stop. We had time for about everyone to do a single rock jump, and that was about it. The current from the falls was also rather strong, and some of the weaker swimmers needed some assistance getting back to shore.</p>
<p>I was one of the last jumpers, and when I swam back to shore it was decided that we should pack back up and leave. The few people behind me in the jumping line dove in, and swam to the rest of us. The stragglers got their gear on and we started to head back.</p>
<p>At this point a little geography is required to understand the predicament. The pool with the waterfall was circular and we were at the bottom of it. If your back is towards the fall, then the “path” back will be on your left side. This path involves hopping over rocks and wading through water for about 100 to 200 feet, then crossing to the right side to get to the real dirt path.</p>
<p>There were two students at the front of the line that were about to wade through some water when everything happened. The waterfall grew huge and unleashed all of the pent up rainwater that had accumulated over the last hour. The waterfall was nothing out of the ordinary, I’d say that it flowed over 10% of the top of the rim normally. All of sudden it jumped to 100%. I do not think I can truly define the sight of the liquid fury that had been loosed. What used to be a pleasant mist from the falls became a sandblaster that pushed the tiny piece of mud into hair, eyes, mouth and skin. You could look at the waterfall for merely an instant before needing to shield your eyes from the sand. Beyond all of this, the noise deafened everything else, it was as if a freight train was passing right by us.</p>
<p>The water level rose instantly, and rocks that we had jumped across just minutes before were submerged below the roaring water.</p>
<p>Had we been a minute slower getting out of the pool, people would have died, plain and simple. Additionally, had we been a minute quicker, those in the front who would have been wading through the water would have been carried off by the current. I cannot discount the timing of all this enough. God was watching over us, and we were protected from the storm solely by His hands.</p>
<p>We started to scamper up the hill that we were still on. I did see some small seeds of panic had begun to manifest, so I tried yelling over the din as calmly as possible, “YOU ARE GOING TO BE OK. GO SLOWLY!” while at the same time, praying for safety in the storm. I alternated between a basic cry for help to God, and reciting what I could remember of Psalm 121.</p>
<p>At this point, I was at the very back of the line. The person in front me briefly lost his footing, and I bear hugged him up against the wall as we were making our way across. Our best bet for high ground and cover was up a tiny embankment that was covered with bamboo (it looked like bamboo anyway) and plants. In the rush we ended up splitting into two groups; one made of people towards the head of the group, and everyone else. We were still in the same general location, but didn’t have a way to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The people in our group made their way up to higher ground and broke off branches to make as much room as they could. Everyone filed up to the spot and bunched together as well as they could. Things were still chaotic, and I and a few others were still only a few feet above what was rushing below us.</p>
<p>From here, we waited. We were as high as we could climb and couldn’t dare to cross to the other side of the river. Even though the danger of drowning was gone, others were already lined up to take the place. Since the waterfall was still so close to us, it was impossible to dry off. Everyone was wearing swimsuits and basic covering, so if the waters didn’t subside in a certain amount of time, cold would have become an issue. Additionally, this was meant to be a day hike so nobody had a flashlight in the event the sun went down. Ultimately, if this did happen, things would have turned from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Flash floods happen every year in Arizona, and you always see the helicopter rescues of people dumb enough to try to drive through a flood zone. We talked about helicopters here, but since we were in a canyon it would have likely been infeasible.  For all intents and purposes, we were on our own.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes, Roy managed to break through the bamboo that separated us from the other group. We confirmed that everyone was indeed safe, which was a relief. He informed us that there was no danger of water rising to our perch because all of the vegetation that surrounded us was indication that flood waters didn’t go that high.</p>
<p>Again, we waited some more. This was particularly tough on some of the people at the top of our hill. Their perch was small and steep, meaning they couldn’t get a comfortable foothold. People would take turns leaning against the hard rock wall before needing to shift to a new spot.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sun broke through. Some of the older folks sang a rendition of Good Day Sunshine that lifted the spirits. The rain had stopped, but the waters were still too high and too fast to attempt a return. More waiting was needed.</p>
<p>We could see that the water was dropping; rocks that had previously been submerged started to show their peaks. After perhaps an hour and a half from our initial frenzy to the high ground, we finally embarked back towards camp.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle was immediately beyond our position. While the water had lowered, and the current slowed, certain spots in the river were still treacherous. Fortunately Roy had a rope, and managed to attach it to assist with the worst part. We went one by one across a rock, using the rope for balance. Some of us did slip, but they were able to regain their footing and everyone made it across.  I was one of the slippers, and briefly dipped my backpack completely underwater. I gritted my teeth, but was thankful that I had just fully insured everything in there before the trip.</p>
<p>With that behind us, it was a simple trip back. The current was still pretty strong, and some of the rattled students needed an extra hand to cross here and there, but the most serious injury was that the water had washed off the bug repellant, creating a buffet for all the mosquitos around the river.</p>
<p>We made it back to camp. Nobody was hurt beyond scrapes and bruises, nobody suffered from hypothermia, but everyone was covered in mud. A cold shower never felt so good. My shoes had an extra 5 pounds of dirt and gravel in them. By the time we left camp, several days later, they were still not dry. Eventually, my camera dried out and was working for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>All in all, it quite the adventure! I truly believe that there is no blame that should be shouldered by anyone. This was a freak occurrence, and now the camp leadership knows the signs to prevent this from happening again. Yes, we should have turned back when it started raining harder, but I can understand the logic and decision behind pressing on. If I had never seen a flash flood in 10+ years in a location, I would have done the same thing. It could have been worse, but God was protecting us out there.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p>He will not let your foot be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber. Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
<p>The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand. The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
<p>The Lord will keep you from all evil; He will keep your life. The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.</p>
<p>–Psalm 121, ESV</p>

<p>Microsoft gets a not-entirely-undeserved reputation for being &#8220;evil&#8221; by the Slashdot crowd. I will admit that I still find some of the decisions they make as a company are boneheaded, but recently, some of the dealings I&#8217;ve had with developers from within the company have been great, and just downright friendly.</p> <p>First off is Scott Hanselman. He&#8217;s always been very approachable and has replied to my emails and twitterings.</p> <p>Specifically though, I&#8217;ve been starting work on a project and was at one point 100% sold on using Open Source based platforms to run it on (<a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a>, <a href="http://www.pylonshq.com">Pylons</a>, and <a href="http://www.postgresql.com">Postgresql</a>). Then I discovered Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/">BizSpark</a> initiative. Briefly, it allows small companies/startups to have <strong>free</strong> access to Microsoft&#8217;s server properties, <em>including production licenses</em>. After three years (or generating $1M per year) you are required to pay full price, but by then you should have either failed, or be receiving enough revenue to afford them.</p> <p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams/status/1013585609">tweeted</a> my intrigue of the program, and received a <a href="http://twitter.com/anandiyer/status/1014183736">reply</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/anandiyer">Anand Iyer</a> encouraging me to contact <a href="http://www.haacked.com">Phil Haack</a> about the ASP.NET MVC framework and a willingness to get me set up with BizSpark, should I go that direction. I do not follow anandiyer on Twitter, and he does not follow me, which means that he was actively searching for people to help through Twitter.</p> <p>Next, I contacted Phil through his blog&#8217;s contact form (I knew his Microsoft email, but wasn&#8217;t sure if it was correct etiquette to email him direct). I had actually had some dealings with him a few years ago, before he was employed by Microsoft, and have been following his blog for quite some time. I used his open source blog platform, SubText, to power this blog for a while and submitted a bug report or two.</p> <p>It did take him a few days to get back to me, though it was the Thanksgiving holiday. In fact, he replied on the day after Thanksgiving, I certainly didn&#8217;t check my company mail over that break. After that email I decided to jump back into the Microsoft stack. I sent him a thank you email, and didn&#8217;t expect a reply (I probably wouldn&#8217;t have sent one), but a couple of hours later, I got a nice &#8220;Good luck!&#8221; email. Totally unnecessary, but still a nice thing to do.</p> <p>Lastly, I&#8217;ve been watching <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/#MVCStorefrontStarterKit">Rob Conery&#8217;s video series on ASP.NET MVC</a>, and thoroughly enjoying them. He not only covers MVC, but also Linq To SQL, Test Driven Development, and a couple of nice patterns that go along with it. I had a question about the coding style in one of the videos and sent him an email, this time directly to his MS address. He responded in less than 10 minutes, far quicker than I would have expected, and answered the question I had.</p> <p>I don&#8217;t post these encounters to suck up or try to defend some of Microsoft&#8217;s past practices, but it is completely apparent to me that Microsoft has some good people working there right now. Some critics will never be satisfied, but I really hope that these experiences are indicative of the direction Microsoft is heading. It&#8217;s done enough for me that it looks like I will be a customer of their&#8217;s for at least the near future.</p>

<p>Nobody thought I could ever do it.

<p>I have always hated writing status reports. Some of my past managers can attest to this. And since I&#8217;d always put them off to the last minute, I&#8217;d forget exactly what it was I&#8217;d been working on, and bosses don&#8217;t like it when a status report consists solely of &#8220;I did stuff.&#8221;</p>  <p>Since I am a programmer, I figured that computers could automate part, if not most, of the process for me. I generally prefer to use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SubVersion</a> as my Source Control Management system, and there is a handy api out there called <a href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/">pysvn</a>. Using this and the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a>, I cooked up a <a href="http://krazyyak.com/svnreport/">neat little application</a> that automatically creates a report based on the messages logged with each check-in. </p>  <p>This is a 0.1 release, so it doesn&#8217;t do a whole lot other than look pretty and make a report. But, here are some other features nonetheless:</p>  <ul>
<li>Works with a password protected repository, just enter the username and password (these are not stored). </li>    <li>Intelligent date ranges. If you enter a start date and no enter, it assumes you want every check-in from that date on. Vice versa with end date as well. </li>    <li>Check-in messages can be formatted using the <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> markup generator to look extra pretty. </li> </ul>
<p>Additionally, if and when bugs are discovered, they can be logged in <a href="https://swilliams.fogbugz.com/default.asp?pg=pgPublicEdit">FogBugz</a>. I do have a slate of features I want to implement in the next revision, but I&#8217;m not sure when I will have the time.</p>  <p></p>  <h3>Screenshots</h3>  <p></p>  <p>    </p>  <hr>

<p>I&#8217;ve deployed the latest version of my <a href="http://photo.krazyyak.com">Photoblog</a>, 0.4.0. There are a few behind the scenes stuff that make it easier for me to upload photos, so I should hopefully be updating it more regularly. My backlog is still in spring &#8216;07 *cough*. Relevant changes:</p> <ul>
<li>Date uploaded is now displayed. My wife showed some confusion over the ordering of the photos. This should clear things up.</li> <li>EXIF info is now available for those of you that are interested in that sort of thing. Click on the &#8220;info&#8221; button to display it.</li> <li>Administration functions improved. A file upload control is available rather than manually FTPing the photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Development is progressing slowly, but surely. It&#8217;s not really an ambitious project, but I&#8217;ve gotten to know Python and the <a href="http://pylonshq.com">Pylons</a> framework pretty well over the course. Next update will fix a few minor bugs and add more admin functions.</p>

					<img alt="I've written about having a server at home before, but I'd like to re-evaluate my thoughts on it. I had a quick little Twitter conversation with Mark last night, and felt I should write a bigger blog post a bout my thoughts. Here is my current home network scenario: I have a Vista based Media Center in the closet recording TV and an XBOX 360 running as an extender to serve it back up to the family room. The XBOX is very loud, but isn't too big of a deal when video/music is playing. Our backup system pretty much sucks right now. It consists of burning stuff to DVD-R's, whenever I remember to do so. I realized last night that I hadn't done so in a few months and had about 10 gigabytes of photos not backed up. That is really not good. So, I've been looking at improving our backup solution. We're probably going to end up getting an HP Media Vault, but I considered a few other options as well. Microsoft released a Home Server product not too long ago, and by all accounts, it looks to be pretty good. It does backups very well, and serves all the standard media types out to clients. But it just doesn't do enough for me. Here's what I would consider to be a bunch of killer features: The current backup system is good. Maybe as an added cost allow for online backup over the Internet as well. Kind of like amazon S3, but geared towards home users. Or Mozy integration. Time Machine like UI. I personally think the whole &quot;space&quot; thing in Time Machine is pretty silly, but the concept is good. Windows actually has the functionality already (before Apple even), but the UI is poor. User management. All I would really like is syncing usernames and passwords across different pc's, and maybe some parental controls. Call it Active Directory Lite. Media Center integration. I would love to be able to consolidate all my extra computers into one box. So this would have a tuner built in and record to its local drives. It would need all the necessary ports to connect it to a home theater. Quiet and cool. If this is out by the TV, then it can't be XBOX loud, and since it will be on all the time, it shouldn't be an energy hog. If the new Atom CPU can do HD video, it would be perfect. I realize most of these are rather pie-in-the-sky, but if something like that were squeezed into the form factor of the HP MediaSmart, then I would be all over it. Some of these things may be in the next version of Home Server, so I am eagerly anticipating it." src="/images/assets/1220892385000.jpg">

<p>I&#8217;ve written about having a server at home before, but I&#8217;d like to re-evaluate my thoughts on it. I had a quick little <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> conversation with <a href="http://markmacleod.com">Mark</a> last night, and felt I should write a bigger blog post a bout my thoughts.

<p>I really enjoy the flavor that sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives together and wanted to do something crispy with them. The first time I made this, I didn&#8217;t add the feta, or salt the tortillas. It was still pretty good, but the feta sealed the deal.</p> <p>I considered using flatbread instead of tortillas, but I think that would be too thick. Some fresh basil might be good as a garnish too, I&#8217;ll try that in the future.</p> <p>And considering I made this up as I went, the measurings are probably inaccurate, use your own discretion.</p> <p>Ingredients, 1 serving:</p> <ul>
<li>2 T Diced Shallots (or onions)  </li>
<li>1 T Sun Dried Tomatoes, diced  </li>
<li>1 T Kalamata Olives, diced  </li>
<li>1 Clove Garlic, diced  </li>
<li>2 T butter or olive oil  </li>
<li>2 T Canola Oil  </li>
<li>2 Tortillas (I prefer the &#8220;raw&#8221; ones that need to be cooked)  </li>
<li>1/4 Cup Shrimp, chopped  </li>
<li>1 T Lemon Juice  </li>
<li>1 T White Wine  </li>
<li>2 T Feta cheese  </li>
<li>Salt for taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Put shrimp in glass bowl and add lemon juice and wine.</p> <p>Cook up the tortillas (if needed) and set aside.</p> <p>Melt butter and saute shallots for several minutes over Medium heat. Add tomatoes and olives and continue to saute. Add some white wine to deglaze pan if needed.</p> <p>Add garlic and shrimp. Cook for a couple of minutes until shrimp is done.</p> <p>In a clean pan, add canola oil and a small pinch of salt. Turn heat up to medium high. Rub a small amount of salt onto the tortilla. Place one tortilla in pan and add the shrimp/olive/tomato mixture. Add feta cheese and cover with the other tortilla. Brown each side to make it crispy. Remove to plate, and cut into quarters.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just do not understand Microsoft. Windows Media Center is a very good DVR/front end, and pound for pound, arguably the best out there right now. It is easy to set up, simple to use, and aesthetically pleasing. And Microsoft claims that it is an important part in their &#8220;living room experience,&#8221; yet they have barely done anything to support it.</p>  <p>Media Center is basically the exact same thing that was introduced back in 2003. Yes the UI has been updated, and some things have been added, but the main selling points are the same. It&#8217;s seen about the same level of commitment as Vista&#8217;s &#8220;Ultimate Extras.&#8221;</p>  <p>What could be done to help right the ship? Firstly is the whole &#8220;Internet TV&#8221; thing. <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu.com</a> is awesome, and would be a killer feature if it were built into Media Center. <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WatchNow">Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly</a> is similar, and already has a <a href="http://www.anpark.com/Software.aspx">3rd Party plugin</a>, but should be bought or re-created in-house.</p>  <p>The second is to focus on one product. The truly amazing thing is just how many separate technologies Microsoft is developing that do the same thing. <a href="http://www.msntv.com">MSN TV</a> is a set top box designed for streaming television over the Internet. <a href="http://www.microsoftmediaroom.com">Media Room</a> has nearly the same feature set as Media Center, and a confusing name to boot. Has anybody even <em>heard</em> of these products? </p>  <p>Additionally, they need to move Media Center to the living room. The Xbox is just too hot and loud, and Extenders are still poorly designed and ugly. If Microsoft could release a set-top box that functioned as a complete Media Center, without the need for a PC, they would have a killer product. Give it a modest hard drive (say 80 gigs) with the option to stream to and from a networked PC. Give it DVR functionality, Flickr, Hulu, Netflix, Joost (maybe), YouTube, and Rhapsody or a similar music streaming service. Dump the worthless and clumsy &#8220;stores&#8221; that are currently offered: MovieLink, CinemaNow, etc, and tie it into the Xbox Live store. Sell it for $250 - $300 and you&#8217;d have an amazing product that would sell very well if marketed properly. I&#8217;d buy one anyway.</p>  <p>Of course, the cynic in me sees this happening instead: someone (probably Apple, since they&#8217;ve already done it, several times) swooping in and releasing that product and stealing their lunch. Microsoft tries to do something similar, but can&#8217;t keep up (eg. Zune) and fails for several years before pulling the plug. </p>
