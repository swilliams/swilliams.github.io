<div><em>And now, here&#8217;s my arbitrary and subjective look at Spotify and Rdio.</em></div>
<p>Spotify has now launched in the US. This is good news. I had originally checked it out a year ago using a proxy to pretend to be British<sup>1</sup>, but it was too much of a hassle to keep maintaining the proxy connection to be worthwhile. Fortunately around the same time I discovered Rdio, and have been a happy subscriber with them ever since.</p>
<div>But now, there&#8217;s a choice! Since I had that other account, I was able to just switch my location and jump right back into Spotify. So, let&#8217;s do a little compare and contrast between the two services. I have the Rdio Unlimited plan ($10/month) and since I&#8217;m just sampling Spotify, using their limited free plan.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Ads</strong></div>
<div>Rdio offers no free plan, but with Spotify you can get 10 hours of music per month with ads, both as banners in the app and audible ones between songs. The ads are pretty obnoxious, but that&#8217;s what you get for free. Some people are actually complaining about this. I just want to make sure that I&#8217;m understanding this one: You want a music service that gives you unlimited access to music, for free, with no advertisements at all, right? Why not ask for a pony that craps skittle flavored gold too?</div>
<p></p>
<div>If I do switch it&#8217;ll be to a paid Spotify plan, so ads are a moot point with me.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Music Selection</strong></div>
<div>Both seem to be pretty comparable. There are some gaps (both their Calexico selections are far too weak), but my tastes are well represented.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Rdio is better at finding new music. They have a Recommended page that suggests music that you might like based on your listening habits, but I&#8217;ve never had much luck with it. What I do find useful is Rdio&#8217;s New Releases section. It lists all the albums that are new to Rdio (new releases, re-issues, or just new to the service).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Most of the stuff I just don&#8217;t care for, but there&#8217;s usually a couple of things worth listening to each week.</div>
<div>Spotify does have a &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; page, but it isn&#8217;t nearly as good. It lists only 8 albums at a time, and those don&#8217;t seem to have a clearly defined meaning of &#8220;new&#8221;: there&#8217;s a Brittney Spears album there that&#8217;s been out for a while (I think), I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s new to Spotify, or just &#8220;Hot&#8221;. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Rdio also has a radio utility, which will play random songs based on what is on your current screen, and other criteria you can provide. It&#8217;s no Pandora, but works as a decent Party Shuffle if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Library Management</strong></div>
<div>Spotify&#8217;s playlist implementation is much better than Rdio&#8217;s, period. Unless I&#8217;m missing something, you can only add or remove songs one at a time with Rdio. This is downright painful.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Spotify presents lists as a standard list view, meaning you can select multiple things, and then do whatever you want with them.</div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Neither of them support complex or &#8220;Smart&#8221; playlists like can be found in iTunes. This is really too bad, since it&#8217;s a powerful feature<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Additionally, Spotify has a &#8220;favorites&#8221; functionality. You can click the star icon next to a song, which will add it to the special Starred list. Rdio doesn&#8217;t have anything like this. I ended up creating a playlist in Rdio called &#8220;Neato&#8221; and manually added songs to that, which isn&#8217;t nearly as nice.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Both apps will look at your local music and add it to the library if you&#8217;d like that (I don&#8217;t), although Spotify keeps things a little cleaner by having a separate Local Files list in their sidebar.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Spotify&#8217;s concept of a Library is: &#8220;Music you&#8217;ve starred, imported, bought, or added to a playlist&#8221;. This is a problem for me. If I like an album, I want to add it to my library. The only way to do this is to add it to a playlist or star it. I ended up creating an Everything playlist and dropping stuff in there, which doesn&#8217;t feel quite right. Rdio&#8217;s library (called Collection) is just a big bucket. You can click on a song or album and add it to your Collection. This makes more sense to me, and seems more analogous to a traditional CD collection.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Rdio will kind of give you metrics on what you have listened to. In your collection, there are blobs of artists (or songs). The bigger the blob, the more you&#8217;ve listened to that artist (or song). Hovering over a blob will give you an exact number, but that&#8217;s about it. I&#8217;d prefer something like iTunes&#8217;s actual playcount on each song.</div>
<div><strong></strong></div>
<div>It also is not all that representative; I saw that The Clash&#8217;s Sandinista! was available, but that&#8217;s a big triple album; each run through counts as 36 listens. It&#8217;s a good album, but I&#8217;ve only listened to it 3 times in the last year and it is rather prominent on my Most Played list.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>UX</strong></div>
<div>You can do more with Spotify, but I found Rdio&#8217;s interface to be more intuitive. Both apps support creating a queue of songs to serve as a running playlist. Spotify&#8217;s has some weird behavior associated with it. If you are on track 3 of an album, and then add another to the queue, that new album will start as soon as the current song has ended. I would expect it to queue up at the end of the list, as Rdio&#8217;s does.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I have no idea what&#8217;s going on here. I added the Bon Iver album, and two others after it, but it is still showing up at the bottom of the queue, with no way to remove it. I don&#8217;t know what will happen once I reach the end of The National album that&#8217;s queued up.</div>
<p></p>
<div><em>Update - this has taken a while to write, so my queue finally worked its way down to those repeated Bon Iver tracks, and played them again&#8230; Still don&#8217;t know how that happened.</em></div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Social</strong></div>
<div>Both services have standard Twitter and Facebook integration. Nothing special here. </div>
<p></p>
<div>One thing that Rdio does have over Spotify is that it supports embedding a little widget in a web page that will play a clip of a song. This is pretty handy to share stuff with non-Rdio subscribers. The only wish I have was that it would play the whole song, like the late lamented Lala, but I doubt they&#8217;d ever be able to wrangle the content providers into allowing that. Spotify has something similar, but requires listeners to have Spotify accounts to listen in, and isn&#8217;t embeddable.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rdio also has its own social network built into it. You can follow people and see what they listen to. Of course, this is only as useful as the number of people you know with similar tastes as yourself.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Both services have desktop apps for Mac OS X. Both support the media keys for play/pause, next, and previous. Rdio uses Flash for it&#8217;s rights management streaming, but nowadays bundles it with the app (like Chrome). I don&#8217;t have Flash installed system wide, so this is a nice touch. It doesn&#8217;t look like Spotify is based on Flash tech, or at least, I couldn&#8217;t find any in the Package Contents.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
<div>I really like Spotify&#8217;s playlist management, but I think I like everything else in Rdio more. I can live with (and have for the past year) Rdio&#8217;s crummy playlist support, but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be alright with Spotify&#8217;s UI quirks. I think I&#8217;ll hang on to the free version of Spotify to see if they can iron out some of the UI issues, but I&#8217;m not going to be canceling Rdio any time soon.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div><span><span>Notes</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>1. I found the ads for &#8220;Crisps&#8221; delivered in &#8220;proper English&#8221; to be downright delightful.</span></span></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div><span><span>2. For example. I have a playlist in iTunes called &#8220;Pool&#8221; that has songs that are: at least 3 stars, longer than 30 seconds (to avoid terrible &#8220;skits&#8221;), and not holiday music. Then, I have another playlist called &#8220;Good&#8221; that takes only songs in Pool that are 4 or 5 stars, and haven&#8217;t been listened to in the last month. This is my main list to listen to: it rotates my favorite songs and doesn&#8217;t get stuck on the same songs over and over. Nothing like this is possible to Rdio or Spotify.</span></span></div>

Unfortunately, he has hit a really big legal snag. Jay Maisel, the photographer who took the cover shot of the original album, <a href="http://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/">sued Baio over the altered cover</a> he used. In order to avoid a drawn out and expensive legal battle, Baio settled for $32,500. The Internet has collectively flipped out. <p></p>
<div>Here&#8217;s what I wrote on the Hacker News story about it:</div>

I&#8217;m guessing the Internet would either be satisfied or angry that $32K is too little for such deep pockets.  </blockquote> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">  </blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s been a whirlwind last 48 hours, and I now finally have a few minutes. My mind is still spinning. </p>
<p></p>
<div>My Saturday, Sunday, (and part of Monday) was spent at the <a href="http://zackarias.com/workshop/">OneLight Workshop</a> that <a href="http://zackarias.com">Zack Arias</a> puts on. I&#8217;ve been following his blog for some time and as soon as I saw that he was coming to Phoenix, I jumped at the chance.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Saturday night was just a mixer to get to know Zack and the other photographers. It was at <a href="http://gangplankhq.com/">Gangplank&#8217;s workspace</a>, and if you haven&#8217;t been there before, do make the trip. They have a great vibe and community at the place. If I lived just a little bit closer, I&#8217;d frequent the place much more often.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If you&#8217;ve ever read Zack&#8217;s blog, or heard him in an interview, he is the exact same dude in person. Which I love.  When Erica and I walked into the mixer he put out his hand and said &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Zack&#8221;. I, and everyone else there knew who he was (his name was in the freaking title of the workshop), but he still introduced himself like salf-of-the-earth kind of guy that he is.</div>
<p></p>
<div>All of the morning and part of the afternoon was a lecture on lighting. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect out of this. When I hear &#8220;5 hour lecture&#8221; I look for my pillow, or start dinking around on <a href="http://twitter.com/swilliams">Twitter</a>. However, the first time I checked my phone, it was already 1pm. He had managed to talk so effectively that my stomach didn&#8217;t even harass me at its normal time. This is no small feat. </div>
<p></p>
<div>I had precisely two huge light-bulb moments during the lecture too. The first was regarding dialing in the best exposure, and the second was me finally really grasping how to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse-square law</a>. These alone were worth the price of admission.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Everything else went swimmingly. The models were incredibly gracious and patient in putting up with 10 relative newbies. I&#8217;ve included my favorites from our time with them. Just in case I didn&#8217;t have enough reasons to love the guy, I stuck around for a little while longer and Zack gave me some input on <a href="http://shootsy.com">Shootsy</a>. We ended at around 2am on Monday. And yes, I had to go to work about 6 hours after that.</div>
<p></p>
<div>All in all, I would <strong>highly</strong> recommend this to anyone looking to get better at flash based lighting.</div>

					<img alt="Since I have a certain level of self-loathing I decided to upgrade our app to the latest version of Rails (as of now, 3.0.3). Rails 3 is a big upgrade and change from Rails 2. One of the biggest areas getting a facelift is the routing system. In general this guide does a great job explaining everything, but I recently ran into a rather specific wall. By default Rails prefers you to use what they call &quot;RESTful Routes&quot;. I'm rather indifferent to the idea, but I go along with it. This provides you with 7 default routes for a resource. For example, say you create routes for a Model called &quot;Photo&quot;. This will create the following routes (stolen from the aforementioned guide): This kind of approach works for 95% of my needs, but sometimes you just need to define something beyond the defaults. Say you need an action called &quot;DoThis&quot;. You can simply modify your Photo route like so:     resources :photos do         member do             get :dothis         end     end And then /photos/1/dothis will map to a dothis method in your controller. This works as expected, but I needed to submit a form to a custom route as well. So, I just added this to my member do function:     post :dothat I then attempted to submit a form to the dothat action, but got a Routing Error telling me the route wasn't found. I double checked and the URL was definitely correct.     &lt;%= form_for(@photo, :url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; 'photos', :action =&gt; 'dothat'} ) do |f| %&gt; It generated the correct URL: photos/1/dothat, which I confirmed by calling rake routes at the command line.  After searching the Interent and only getting frustrated I finally saw something that jogged my memory. In REST, 'post' is for creating new resources. I was editing my model. Simply changing it to:     put :dothat Fixed everything.  I'll attribute that mixup to years and years of having only GET and POST available drilled into my head. It doesn't exactly help that Rails doesn't use a &quot;real&quot; PUT in the form's method attribute. It uses POST, but includes a hidden input, &quot;_method&quot; to store the verb it should respond to." src="/images/assets/1291761300000.jpg">

<p>Since I have a certain level of self-loathing I decided to upgrade our app to the latest version of Rails (as of now, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/11/15/rails-3-0-3-faster-active-record-plus-plenty-of-fixes">3.0.3</a>). Rails 3 is a big upgrade and change from Rails 2. One of the biggest areas getting a facelift is the routing system.</p>
<p></p>
<div>In general this <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html">guide</a> does a great job explaining everything, but I recently ran into a rather specific wall. By default Rails prefers you to use what they call &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">RESTful</a> Routes&#8221;. I&#8217;m rather indifferent to the idea, but I go along with it. This provides you with 7 default routes for a resource. For example, say you create routes for a Model called &#8220;Photo&#8221;. This will create the following routes (stolen from the aforementioned guide):</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>This kind of approach works for 95% of my needs, but sometimes you just need to define something beyond the defaults. Say you need an action called &#8220;DoThis&#8221;. You can simply modify your Photo route like so:</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div><span>    resources :photos do</span></div>
<div><span>        member do</span></div>
<div><span>            get :dothis</span></div>
<div><span>        end</span></div>
<div><span>    end</span></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>And then <span>/photos/1/dothis</span> will map to a <span>dothis</span> method in your controller. This works as expected, but I needed to submit a form to a custom route as well. So, I just added this to my member do function:</div>
<p></p>
<div>    <span>post :dothat</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>I then attempted to submit a form to the <span>dothat</span> action, but got a Routing Error telling me the route wasn&#8217;t found. I double checked and the URL was definitely correct.</div>
<p></p>
<div>    <span>&lt;%= form_for(@photo, :url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; &#8216;photos&#8217;, :action =&gt; &#8216;dothat&#8217;} ) do |f| %&gt;</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>It generated the correct URL: <span>photos/1/dothat</span>, which I confirmed by calling rake routes at the command line. </div>
<p></p>
<div>After searching the Interent and only getting frustrated I finally saw <a href="http://asciicasts.com/episodes/203-routing-in-rails-3">something</a> that jogged my memory.</div>
<p></p>
<div>In REST, &#8216;post&#8217; is for <em>creating</em> new resources. I was <em>editing</em> my model. Simply changing it to:</div>
<p></p>
<div>    <span>put :dothat</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Fixed everything. </div>
<p></p>
<div>I&#8217;ll attribute that mixup to years and years of having only GET and POST available drilled into my head. It doesn&#8217;t exactly help that Rails doesn&#8217;t use a &#8220;real&#8221; PUT in the form&#8217;s method attribute. It uses POST, but includes a hidden input, &#8221;<span>_method</span>&#8221; to store the verb it should respond to.</div>

(Yeah, that’s a computer in your car.) I attempted it when I was 18: it was a bunch of old PC parts inside a Dremeled-out Rubbermaid tub with a gamepad next to my parking brake to control Winamp so I could play MP3s. It was ridiculous. I had to wait until my carputer booted Windows 98 before it could play music. Even I couldn’t take this thing seriously. It lasted about 3 days until I drove over a speed bump and the CPU fell out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_II" target="_blank">slot</a>. I scrapped it and just bought an MP3-CD player (the second one ever released) instead.</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>I have to admit that when I was a little younger, the thought of a <i>carputer</i> was almost irresistible. However I was just never able to cobble together the right kind of parts. I did attempt some other &#8220;questionable&#8221; computer hacks as well; they worked about as good as Marco&#8217;s.</div> </div></div>
