	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It may sometimes appear that I am a <a href="https://pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/articles/getting-back-to-the-roots-of-agile">little harsh on Agile</a>. In general though, I really like the principles behind it. I&rsquo;m a big fan of breaking big things into smaller things. That way you have a better chance of truly understanding the problem in front of you. But, like all things, it has problems. If you get really good at Agile (capital A), you are dilligent about keeping a tidy backlog made of hundreds (or more) issues/stories/tasks/blah. Those are assigned to developers each sprint. And, after enough sprints, you are done, and it&rsquo;s perfect! Right? Right??? Anyone?</p>

<p>Ok, ok. The word &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; was tongue-in-cheek because it&rsquo;s never perfect. Chances are there was a time crunch and shortcuts were taken. &ldquo;Workarounds&rdquo; are needed in too many places. To borrow a carpentry term, certain corners just don&rsquo;t line up the way they should.</p>

<p>And yet, each of the stories were completed. What happened?</p>

<p>Something that I&rsquo;ve been seeing, on large projects especially, has been a kind of tunnel vision that developers adopt when working through a queue of issues. Software projects have a tendency to fall behind schedule all on their own, and as developers start to feel the pressure to ship, it turns into <em>get as many of these stories done as quickly as possible omg</em>. Rather than thinking of the project they are building, they are only seeing the individual tasks in front of them.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to place blame on developers, it&rsquo;s the nature of working through a queue and only a queue. This is a bad analogy, but think of it as a database schema that is far too normalized for its own good. Getting something worthwhile out of that scenario takes more work and time than it should.</p>

<p>So what do you do to fix that? I don&rsquo;t think you can throw out the bad parts of The Process without throwing out the good parts too. Breaking things into smaller pieces and creating a backlog is <em>still good</em>. I think the issue stems from what happens around the issues and not the issues themselves.</p>

<p>How do most developers start a project? If they were not there at the genesis of the project, they&rsquo;re probably rolled immediately into that backlog. Even if they were at the beginning of a project, what did they do? They may have helped with the scoping, or seen some initial designs, but that&rsquo;s about it. There&rsquo;s a good chance they got a brief intro and then had issues assigned to them. I know I&rsquo;ve certainly guilty of this. On one particularly massive project that I lead I could really only spare a couple of hours of walking through a codebase at a high level, and then wishing them godspeed, and rushing off to my next meeting. Is it any surprise that the people on the receiving end of that end up not &ldquo;getting it&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Empathy is critical in all things, and software development is no exception.</p>

<p>full-part of the process
Onboarding after work begins is treacherous
Empathy</p>
