    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pricing is tricky for mobile apps these days. When I was <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/06/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/">developing Emergency Contacts</a>, I knew I had a few options to choose from:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> — The app didn&rsquo;t take too long to make, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I wanted to just give it away for free. I thought that it had provided a modest amount of utility, so I figured that just straight up free wouldn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li><strong>Free with an In-App Purchase</strong> — I did this with <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>. But since the feature set on Emergency Contacts is pretty small, I couldn&rsquo;t think of what to lock in an extra purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Free with ads</strong> — I just don&rsquo;t like ads in apps. I didn&rsquo;t even look to see how to get this set up.</li>
<li><strong>Paid</strong> — The choice was really between free and $0.99. Since I had ruled out free, that left me here.</li>
</ul>


<p>Figuring out pricing is hard. I think I made the right choice here, though with a more complex app, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d do the same thing.</p>
