    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve been through the <a href="/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages">pre-history</a>, and then the <a href="/words/2014/01/25/my-computers-through-the-ages-part-ii">awkward years</a>. Now we come at last to the present. From here on out, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> all the way down, so if that ruins your day, please feel free to stop reading and go outside to contemplate your existance.</p>

<p>Why did I switch? Most of it came down to what I use a computer for. I&rsquo;m a software developer by trade. The first part of my career was mostly in the Microsoft stack, but by the late 2000&rsquo;s I got the itch to move on to <a href="/words/2013/12/02/the-frustrations-of-the-journeyman/">something else</a>. Every kind of development platform that I&rsquo;m interested in runs better on a Unix-like system. Apple doesn&rsquo;t make me happy 100% of the time, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be leaving their ecosystem for a while.</p>

<p><strong>24" iMac</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp507">(2009)</a> I&rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting when I made the switch, but I wasn&rsquo;t terribly fond of this one. The hardware was great; a beautiful display, pretty fast processor, and a spacious hard drive. I loved that I didn&rsquo;t have a beige butt-ugly tower on my desk anymore. My frustrations were entirely with OS X.  It came with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/leopard/">10.5 Leopard</a>, with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/snowleopard/">10.6 Snow Leopard</a> released shortly after the computer showed up on my porch. After upgrading, it had a myriad of reliability problems. What made me grind my teeth were the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_panic">kernel panics</a>. A kernel panic is an error in the Operating System that it cannot recover from, stopping everything and requiring a restart. You might be familiar with its colloquial name on Windows: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_XP_BSOD.png">Blue Screen of Death</a>. I would average one of those every month on my iMac, which is astronomically high for an OS marketed with <a href="http://a3.img.mobypicture.com/570253fecab177d9605be5d157c59e18_view.jpg">&ldquo;it just works&rdquo;</a> as its slogan.</p>

<p>It frustrated me enough that I considered going back to Windows. What held me back was that I had started getting more and more into <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> development, which (still) doesn&rsquo;t run very well on Windows<sup>1</sup>. I had started to work on a <a href="/words/2013/12/26/whither-shootsy-or-how-i-tried-and-failed-a-startup">Rails based project</a> that would have benefited from having a laptop in order to work outside the house. Despite my initial reservations for OS X, I doubled down.</p>

<p><strong>13" MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp583">(2010)</a> This was the cheapest Mac laptop at the time. With impeccable timing, I bought this right before Apple released the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Airs</a>. This wasn&rsquo;t a particularly fast computer, but it showed me how well OS X could work when it doesn&rsquo;t constantly blow up. I don&rsquo;t know if my iMac was a bit of a lemon, or if OS X just works better on laptops, but it was noticeable.</p>

<p>It also made me realize that I could get by with just a laptop. Syncing data between two computers is a bit of a pain, even with things like Dropbox and source control management. On more than one occasion I had to call my wife and walk her through performing an <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/a-tour-of-mercurial-the-basics.html#x_68"><code>hg push</code></a> in order to send me the latest bits of a project. I held on to this computer for a little while and then sold it to put together enough scratch for the next one.</p>

<p><strong>15" MacBook Pro</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp620">(2011)</a> I went laptop only for the first time with this computer. It was my workhorse for almost 3 years. On it, I created Rails apps, iOS apps, and even managed to use it with my day job in .NET-land (through VMWare). It was reliable as a rock even with me mucking around inside it to upgrade the memory and hard drive. Even though I had this computer longer than most others, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot to say about it, which is a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>13" MacBook Pro w/Retina</strong> <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP691">(2014)</a> Here we are (finally) in the present. I didn&rsquo;t think the retina screen would be that much of a deal breaker, but I&rsquo;d rather sell my left foot than give it up now. I can leave my power cord at home and fit in an entire work day on the battery. Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s also crazy fast despite only having a dual-core CPU (my last one was a quad). All of that comes in a package just under 3.5 pounds. I&rsquo;ve only had this computer for a couple of months, but it&rsquo;s already the best one I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring. I like the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, but not enough to spring for its $3000+ price tag. And I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d go back to a desktop again. I&rsquo;d like to hold onto this laptop for as long as I can.</p>

1. Rails by itself runs fine on Windows. It's when you start adding gems into the mix that things start going hinky. And then there's the whole cygwin thing. Ugh.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got my latest computer, a 13" MacBook Pro with a Retina screen. Before my memory fades too much, I want to list the computers that I have (or my family has) owned, and talk a little about the memories associated with them. I wish I could dig up more pictures of some of these, but almost all of them were not important to be deigned worthy of being stored in the cobwebs of Internet history.</p>

<h3>Prehistory</h3>

<p><strong>Compaq Portable</strong> (some point in the late 80&rsquo;s). My dad used to bring this home every so often from his day job at a large bank. It was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_portable">&ldquo;portable&rdquo;</a> even though it weighed 28 pounds. I learned how to type on this thing and wrote a few papers in 3rd grade before my teacher told me to stop and work on my handwriting. I believe it ran MS-DOS 3.0.</p>

<p><figure></p>

<p></figure></p>

<p><strong>IBM &ldquo;Compatible&rdquo;</strong> (early 90&rsquo;s. ) Our first family computer. It had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80386">80386</a> that ran at a smoking 25 MHz. It lasted us for years and years. I wrote more school papers on it, learned how to hide certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game">games</a>) my mother wouldn&rsquo;t approve of<sup>1</sup>, and poked around with a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qbasic">QBasic</a>. It ran MS-DOS 5 and had Windows 3.1.</p>

<p>My earliest memory of this computer was learning that &ldquo;hot&rdquo; was slang for &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; because my dad was convinced that some of the parts weren&rsquo;t legal&hellip; I think he was joking. Probably.</p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="WordPerfect" src="http://blog.swilliams.me/images/assets/Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;WordPerfect&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p>I learned the ins and outs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect#WordPerfect_for_DOS">WordPerfect 5.1</a> to great effect. In 6th grade I was able to astonish one of my classmates by being able to print out 25 copies of the same document without having to re-type the whole thing 25 times.</p>

<p>My first bit of &ldquo;programming&rdquo; that I could be proud of was a batch script in DOS that would take 10 minutes to run by listing every single file on the system, counting to an insanely high number, prompt the user over and over, and generally be as annoying as possible. I would then try to get my little sister to run it as often as I could just to watch her get angry. One time I left it in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> file when my mom needed to use the computer and got in actual trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Unknown Laptop</strong> (mid-late 90&rsquo;s) Another computer we got to borrow from my dad. This time with a little known operating system called Windows 95. It was a fairly primitive laptop, though I was fascinated by the LCD and the weird colors it had unless you looked at it straight on.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really use it for much other than writing papers. Although, it was our first computer to really connect to the Internet (the old 386 had a modem, but at 2400 baud it was much to slow to be of any value). In 1997 I signed up for a Hotmail email address and thought I was pretty awesome.</p>

<p><strong>HP Desktop</strong> (early 1998) A huge upgrade from the old family PC. This sported a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium"><em>Pentium</em></a> processor and Windows 95. I remember being most excited about getting a joystick and being able to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_Fighter_(video_game)">TIE Fighter</a>, a game that was already several years old, but one that I had missed out on. It was also our first computer to come with a CD-ROM. I could listen to music <em>on my computer(!)</em>. This was going to be the PC I was going to take to college, but fate intervened.</p>

<h3>My Own Little&hellip; My Precious</h3>

<p><strong>CTX Desktop</strong> (summer 1998) I was supposed to take the above HP to school with me, and my family had grown used to having a modern computer in the house and wanted to get their own. At Best Buy<sup>2</sup> when my dad was picking it up I jokingly asked &ldquo;Hey Dad, how about I take this to school and you guys keep the older HP?&rdquo; To my surprise, he thought about it for a second, then said &ldquo;ok&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That turned out to be fortuitous for me. At The University of Arizona, I learned that it was surprisingly upgradeable for a store-bought PC. By the time I was done with it, I had upgraded the video card, hard drive, memory, sound card, and added a CD burner and network card. Pretty much everything except was replaced for the Celeron processor that shipped with it. I even tinkered with the OS too. Originally, it was loaded with Windows 98. I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; it to Windows 2000, then eventually went back to 98 because of weird USB issues.</p>

<p>Since this was the first computer I could actually call my own, I felt obligated to really get to know it. It was on this computer that I learned how to actually write code, do a little design work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">pirate music</a>, and play more games. At this point, I definitely got &ldquo;the bug&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After this, I built my own PCs for the next few years. I&rsquo;ll cover those some other time.</p>
