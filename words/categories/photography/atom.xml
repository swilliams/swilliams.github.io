    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have three digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera">SLR</a> cameras<sup>1</sup>, and a bunch of nice lenses to go with them. I&rsquo;ve been an <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">amateur photographer</a>, and have taken tens of thousands (if not more) photos of weddings, portraits, and landscapes over the years. I love my photography gear, and even though I don&rsquo;t use it quite as much as I used to, I&rsquo;m not going to be changing it any time soon.</p>

<p>But, with a few exceptions, I don&rsquo;t think anyone should buy a DSLR anymore.</p>

<p>DSLRs are big. Like, Orca big. Newer models have been hitting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqOZ1JkFFE">Slim-Fast</a>, but you are never going to be able to fit one in a pocket or purse any time soon. This means you will need a dedicated bag or backpack, which means you won&rsquo;t be taking it with you, ever. Part of the reason smartphones have replaced point &amp; shoots is that you always have it with you.</p>

<p>DSLRs are like gym memberships. People pay lots of money for them, use them for about a month, and then never again.</p>

<p>Instead, if you really want to drop several hundred dollars on a camera, get a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">mirrorless</a>. They&rsquo;re a little bit cheaper, will give you the same quality, and are <strong>much</strong> smaller. If I were starting over today, I&rsquo;d get one. <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-follow-up-review-life-without-dslrs/">Even some pros are using them for day to day work.</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some models to check out:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DCM0E5Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DCM0E5Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Fujifilm X-M1</a> &ndash; A bit pricier</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these are small and light. All of them will take great photos. And, you might actually take it with you.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Here are the two people who should probably stick with DSLRs: the Student and the Professional.</p>

<p>By Student I mean someone who wants to <em>learn</em> photography. Someone who wants to know what f-stops are, how they interact with shutter speeds and ISO. If you just want to take pictures of your kids or pets, then go with one of the mirror-less ones.</p>

<p>And, by Professional, I mean someone who wants to make money with their camera. For a bunch of reasons not worth getting into, an SLR is probably the right choice for them. Professional doesn&rsquo;t have to be full-time either (I&rsquo;m certainly not).</p>
