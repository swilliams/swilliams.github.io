    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>[Editor&rsquo;s note: the author will try not to make any terrible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree">U2</a> jokes, but no guarantees, k?]</em></p>

<p>On drive back from visiting my grandfather in Palm Springs, I started to notice a few interesting spots right off of I-10. I got to thinking that even though I&rsquo;ve driven that stretch of road dozens of times I&rsquo;ve never seen what&rsquo;s just down the various exits. When I got home I asked a friend if he wanted to go with me on an adventure, we set a date and went off.</p>

<p>I decided that I didn&rsquo;t have enough stress on my wallet and rented an amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LAJQVR6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LAJQVR6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=SXRLLGQXQE6EXCZV">Nikon D800</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037KM0X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0037KM0X0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=WKK5Q3JEYBRTBVUG">lens</a> to go with it.</p>

<p>I was blown away by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a> of the D800. I thought I&rsquo;d appreciate the step in quality over my older D300, but wow! I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to use a <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/why-i-moved-to-medium-format-phase-one-iq140-review/">medium format setup</a>, but I think I understand just how much of a jump in quality a larger sensor size can make.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s our journey.</p>

<h3>Salome Rd, North off I-10</h3>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Shed" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1300.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Some kind of utility shed off of Salome Rd&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Cactus" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1313.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;I'm not totally sold on the value of having a maximum aperture of f/1.4 on a 24mm lens, but this cactus demonstrates that it can look pretty. Also further down Salome Rd, then Eagle Eye Rd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<h3>Out Past Blythe</h3>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="No Hunting" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1343.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Blythe is a town that people usually stop in for lunch on their way to California or Arizona. We decided to see what's out on the roads that go beyond the fast food.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Rusted Car" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1370.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;According to Apple Maps, Lovekin Rd is supposed to go all the way up to Highway 62. I'm sure it does, but at about 3/4's of the way it becomes a private road and is no longer paved. This rusted out hulk was about 100 yards away from the end.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<h3>Storm and Desert Center</h3>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Storm Comin'" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1374.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Back on I-10. We saw a big weather system moving in and managed to get onto an overpass before it hit us.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Decay" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1383.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Center,_California"&gt;Desert Center&lt;/a&gt; is what gave me the idea to do this trip in the first place. Most of the town looks abandoned, and yields some pretty interesting photo locations.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Family Cafe" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1392.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;It was pouring at this point, but I did manage to run out in the rain long enough to grab this.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Old Gas Pump" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1402.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Next to the caf√© was an ancient gas station. Each of the pumps were in various stages of decay.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Chevron Supreme" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1410.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Chevron Supreme!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Squatted" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1423.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A little west of of the cafe was a group of pre-fabricated houses, kind of like what you'd see from Habitat for Humanity. All of them were basically destroyed from neglect and looked like a refuge for squatters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Tagged" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1428.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;All of them were vandalized too.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Desert" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1432.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;To escape the weather we headed north from Desert Center up Highway 177. In the distance you could see the dust blowing against the mountains.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<h3>Joshua Tree Park</h3>

<p>I finally found what I was looking for. <em>[ed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EabB55IYyOg">Argh!</a> You were warned.]</em></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1464.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Joshua Trees are interesting. They look like palms trees, but with multiple heads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1473.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This is the Dynamic Range I was talking about. The sun is literally right behind the tree, but you can still make out plenty of detail in the shadows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Fat caterpillar" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1505.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We also found lot's of fat caterpillars. This guy looked like he was getting ready to do the chrysalis thing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Jumbo Rocks" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1515.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;If you like bouldering or climbing rocks, this would be the place for you. After this trip, I want to return and camp there to be able to explore all of its crannies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1522.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;By this point I was coming up with various schemes to justify keeping the D800.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1530.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Yup.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<h3>Coming Home</h3>

<p><figure></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="My Scion" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1545.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We drove &lt;a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/04/20/in-which-i-purchased-a-new-car/"&gt;my car&lt;/a&gt; The way out of the park back down to I-10 was filled corners and S-curves. Needless to say, I loved it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

<p>I bought a new camera a little while ago, and finally had the opportunity to put it through its paces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=2PJ4FLG2K25KQBDP">The Fujifilm X100s</a> isn&rsquo;t particularly cheap, so I saved a while to be able to afford it, but so far I&rsquo;m really liking it.</p>

<p>I have three Nikon DSLRs and an assortment of nice lenses to go with them, so why would I want a smaller, almost Point and Shoot camera? For starters, it&rsquo;s much smaller. I love my Nikons, but carrying around a backpack has never been <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr/">convenient</a>, especially when you need to take a shot fast. It can fit in a large pocket, and I have a belt-style pouch for it too. Its lens is fixed at about the equivalent of 35mm on an SLR. You&rsquo;d think being stuck at a single focal length would be an issue, but it&rsquo;s a good size for when its use cases (informal portraits, walking around, &ldquo;street&rdquo; photography). Oh yeah, and the pictures that come out of it are gorgeous.</p>

<p>Where doesn&rsquo;t it stand up very well? When you need to get closer. When you need the absolute <em>best</em> image quality. When you need a high frame-rate of shots (sports). I wouldn&rsquo;t shoot a wedding with just the X100s, but it would be very useful for wandering around during the reception.</p>

<p>Despite those issues, this is probably my go to camera for 80% of my needs right now. If it had been available 10 years ago when I was considering a DSLR purchase, I might&rsquo;ve gone with this instead.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have three digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera">SLR</a> cameras<sup>1</sup>, and a bunch of nice lenses to go with them. I&rsquo;ve been an <a href="http://swilliamsphoto.com">amateur photographer</a>, and have taken tens of thousands (if not more) photos of weddings, portraits, and landscapes over the years. I love my photography gear, and even though I don&rsquo;t use it quite as much as I used to, I&rsquo;m not going to be changing it any time soon.</p>

<p>But, with a few exceptions, I don&rsquo;t think anyone should buy a DSLR anymore.</p>

<p>DSLRs are big. Like, Orca big. Newer models have been hitting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqOZ1JkFFE">Slim-Fast</a>, but you are never going to be able to fit one in a pocket or purse any time soon. This means you will need a dedicated bag or backpack, which means you won&rsquo;t be taking it with you, ever. Part of the reason smartphones have replaced point &amp; shoots is that you always have it with you.</p>

<p>DSLRs are like gym memberships. People pay lots of money for them, use them for about a month, and then never again.</p>

<p>Instead, if you really want to drop several hundred dollars on a camera, get a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera">mirrorless</a>. They&rsquo;re a little bit cheaper, will give you the same quality, and are <strong>much</strong> smaller. If I were starting over today, I&rsquo;d get one. <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-follow-up-review-life-without-dslrs/">Even some pros are using them for day to day work.</a>.</p>

<p><figure></p>

&lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony NEX-F2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p>Here are some models to check out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00836H2BI/thepetzoo-20">Sony NEX-F3</a> &ndash; <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-sony-nex-f3-is-our-favorite-affordable-mirrorless-camera-so-far/">The Wirecutter likes this one</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096WDAIM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0096WDAIM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Olympus E-PM2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DCM0E5Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DCM0E5Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">Fujifilm X-M1</a> &ndash; A bit pricier</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these are small and light. All of them will take great photos. And, you might actually take it with you.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p>Here are the two people who should probably stick with DSLRs: the Student and the Professional.</p>

<p>By Student I mean someone who wants to <em>learn</em> photography. Someone who wants to know what f-stops are, how they interact with shutter speeds and ISO. If you just want to take pictures of your kids or pets, then go with one of the mirror-less ones.</p>

<p>And, by Professional, I mean someone who wants to make money with their camera. For a bunch of reasons not worth getting into, an SLR is probably the right choice for them. Professional doesn&rsquo;t have to be full-time either (I&rsquo;m certainly not).</p>
