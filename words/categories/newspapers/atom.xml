    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day a couple of salespeople for the Arizona Republic came knocking on my door. Here was their pitch:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to start delivering you a paper every Wednesday and Sunday. Would you like it in your driveway or on the roof?&rdquo; and then a pause for laughter. I was more confused; her delivery was pretty bad, and there was a distinct waft of desperation.</p>

<p>I started to explain that I didn&rsquo;t want a newspaper even if it was free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only $.95 per week! You&rsquo;ll make that up with all the coupons you&rsquo;ll be getting!&rdquo; She was pushing the coupons pretty hard. I guess this is why people get newspapers, in order to buy cereal for $.20 off?</p>

<p>I said I didn&rsquo;t really care about coupons and politely told them to have a good afternoon. After extricating myself from the conversation I realized something: not once during their pitch did they mention the actual <em>content</em> of the paper. That&rsquo;s got to be depressing if you&rsquo;re a journalist â€” according to your sales staff your work is nothing more than a coupon delivery system with some words in between.</p>
