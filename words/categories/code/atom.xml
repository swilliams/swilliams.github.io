    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What do you do with a codebase for a client project that ended years ago? Since it&rsquo;s client work it shouldn&rsquo;t be made public, but if you keep it &ldquo;live&rdquo; in GitHub your private repository count will creep up. Deleting the repository outright seems wrong; it&rsquo;s not that unusual to have an old client cold call you with an update, and having that old codebase handy can save some headaches. The lazy way to fix this would be to just give GitHub more money to increase the limit. But I felt the itch to solve the problem with code.</p>

<p>Git itself is flexible. It&rsquo;s trivial to clone a repository, put it in a safe place (or alternate service) and call it a day. But with GitHub, that doesn&rsquo;t include Issues. There could be some solid ideas (or bugs) stored in Open Issues that should be preserved. <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/">GitHub has a great API</a> to retrieve those, and I decided to create a simple Ruby script to make it a smooth process.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Tallwave/github_issue_exporter">GitHub Issue Exporter</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty basic right now â€” just downloads Issues into a bunch of JSON and will also let you import them back into a new project. The idea is that you clone the repository you want to archive, then export all the open issues, store it all in a safe place, then you can safely delete the repository and free up some space.</p>

    <updated>2014-10-30T10:46:09-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/10/30/dealing-with-xcode-and-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/09/10/thoughts-on-swift/">I like Swift</a>. But Xcode&rsquo;s support of Swift is&hellip; lacking (to be polite).</p>

<p>My biggest woe is that code completion up and vanishes in projects. This is especially problematic when dealing with Cocoa libraries because method names tend to be verbose and descriptive. I find myself thinking &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UINavigationController/popToRootViewControllerAnimated:">popToRoot-something-somthing</a> and was it on UIViewController or the navigationController?&rdquo;. What would&rsquo;ve taken two seconds of poking through code-completion to figure that out turned into a solid minute of searching documentation. Multiply this every time you can&rsquo;t explicitly remember every part of a method call (and spell it correctly) and tasks that normally take an hour are now a significant part of a day.</p>

<p>The tools that Apple provides are now hindering development. I&rsquo;m not alone in that sentiment. On Apple&rsquo;s developer forums (account needed to view) there are a few threads with names like <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/1067119#1067119">&ldquo;Can SourceKit possibly crash more often on a Swift project?&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/248397?start=0&amp;tstart=0">&ldquo;Xcode 6.1b3 Swift editing is becoming very difficult&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>One of those threads recommends deleting two folders: <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData</code> and <code>~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode</code>. This does the job for me. It happens often enough that I created a hot key for it with <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>.</p>

<p><figure class="center"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="Keyboard Maestro Screenshot" src="http://blog.swilliams.me/images/assets/xcode-swift-maestro.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;This will yell at you if those folders don't exist, but I can live with that.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></figure></p>

<p>You could do something similar with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> or any other launcher type of app.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad that I have to create this kind of shortcut to maintain my sanity, but I remain hopeful. If Apple is betting big on Swift (and I think they are), then they&rsquo;ll <em>have</em> to improve the tool support for it.</p>

<p>Swift is a new language developed by Apple. I&rsquo;ve been using for a few side projects.</p>

<p>On my first glance, I thought Swift would be a great language for beginners. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure if that&rsquo;s still the case. A beginner language should push you into a positive feedback loop: do something, see it work, do some more, and so on. Swift and Xcode 6 do some of this with aplomb, especially with playgrounds, but I found some features of the language can be frustrating until you have a deeper understanding of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Optionals are the biggest part of that. They&rsquo;re kind of crazy at first. Lot&rsquo;s of ?&rsquo;s and !&rsquo;s running around. When I was starting with Swift, Xcode would constantly complain that I was missing one. Sometimes it would tell me which one was missing, but sometimes it didn&rsquo;t. After reading the documentation a little more and thinking about it, things started to click. Handling nil values is important in any language, and handling them poorly can lead to some truly marvelous bugs or security issues. Swift makes you face them much earlier in the process. I think this is a good thing, though it can make for a frustrating start. It&rsquo;s also made me think if I&rsquo;m handling nils properly in other languages I use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on my own personal style, but I think I should be using more computed properties. A rule I&rsquo;m toying with is to keep on making methods for &ldquo;verbs&rdquo; like <code>moveFileToThing</code>, but use properties for &ldquo;nouns&rdquo; like <code>allSampleAssets</code>, even if that property makes several other calls within its implementation. This might require renaming certain methods in order to better comply with that style; if <code>allSampleAssets</code> took a <code>sort</code> parameter it couldn&rsquo;t be a property, so I&rsquo;d rename it to <code>queryAllSampleAssets(sort: NSSortDescriptor)</code>.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s a brand new thing, there is still a good amount of Objective C and Cocoa baggage. The standard collections use <code>AnyObject</code> where <code>id</code> used to be, which means you&rsquo;ll need to do some explicit casting to the type you need. I found it easier when dealing with an <code>NSDictionary</code> or <code>NSArray</code> to not try to cram all the casting and then manipulating into a single line of code.</p>

<p>Enums have reams of power that could be used for evil. I like the way <a href="http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/130-swift-json-redux-part-1">NSScreencasts uses enums with JSON parsing</a>, but it&rsquo;s hard to comprehend. If you have more of a functional programming background, I suspect this would be easier.</p>

<p>Swift is going to be huge. I think Apple does have a language on its hands that&rsquo;ll last for its next 20 years. There are still some rough edges and potential pitfalls, but It has become the language I prefer when creating iOS apps.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/08/12/porting-db5-to-swift/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T16:41:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/08/12/porting-db5-to-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of using the <a href="https://github.com/quartermaster/DB5">DB5 library</a> for customizing an iOS app via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plist">plist configuration file</a>, and I&rsquo;ve used it in several projects so far. I&rsquo;ve also  been digging more into Swift and iOS 8 and thought it would be a good exercise to familiarize myself more with Swift to port DB5 from its original Objective C codebase to Swift.</p>

<p>The result is over on Github: <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/DB5-Swift">DB5-Swift</a>.</p>

<p>For grins, I wanted to go with a purely Swift approach, no NSWhatever classes unless there was no alternative. This meant using <code>Dictionary</code> instead of <code>NSDictionary</code>. Which turned into a bit of a headache. The biggest issue I ran into was that Swift&rsquo;s Dictionary doesn&rsquo;t seem to have an equivalent of NSDictionary&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000140-CBHBABID"><code>initWithContentsOfFile:</code></a><sup>1</sup>. Rather than try to parse the plist by hand, I just went back with good ole NSDictionary.</p>

<p>Two of Swift&rsquo;s headlining features are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_468">type inference</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_478">optional values</a>. I&rsquo;ve used both of these features before in C# for several years and have appreciated what they bring to the table. Swift is a little bit different though because it comes with the history of Objective C and Cocoa. NSDictionary was built to take advantage of Objective C&rsquo;s type system, and using it with Swift involved more casting and ? and ! operators than I expected. It didn&rsquo;t help that Xcode would often be wrong in its helper tooltips, suggesting addtional !&rsquo;s which wouldn&rsquo;t fix the problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if DB5-Swift is 100% up to snuff right now. I think some of the methods should have better handling for nil values. I still have plenty of learning left before I&rsquo;d consider myself adept at Swift. Overall, it was  a good exercise, and I will use it in future apps.</p>
