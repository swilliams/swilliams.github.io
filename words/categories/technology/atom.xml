    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us">Surface</a> was never the barnburner that Microsoft hoped it would be. People have been <a href="http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140629/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/microsoft-discontinue-surface-tablet">predicting</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/surface-2-prices-slashed-hinting-at-discontinuation-or-replacement/">its demise</a> for the <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/10/09/microsoft-surface-pro-3/">last year</a>. It&rsquo;s suffered from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqyTxiTKxgI">goofy advertising</a> and lately seems to be begging the masses to please think of it instead of an iPad, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jP4O7rEHQ8">anything but an iPad, oh please</a>! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m certainly no Don Draper, but that&rsquo;s not gonna prevent my <del>ego</del> imagination to think of how I&rsquo;d do it instead. The idea is that the Surface apparently has a nice stylus/pen that can be used by artists. Penny Arcarde&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2013/10/28/surface-pro-2">Mike Krahulik has been a fan</a> and used them to draw their popular web comic. That&rsquo;s your angle right there. Now, not many people are artists that would benefit from a refined drawing interface, but plenty of people <em>fancy</em> themselves as such. Nike convinced you that sneakers with compressed air in them would make you Michael Jordan, why isn&rsquo;t Microsoft showing you that Surface would make you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lee">Jim Lee</a>?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your commercial: Camera fades in to reveal someone intently working on a Surface. They&rsquo;re sitting in a comfy chair, or on a couch, or some kind of hipster furniture. We don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s on the screen yet but we can see them concentrating and cranking away at <em>something</em> with the pen. Cut to the over-the-shoulder shot. We now see a painting/sketch/comic coming to life.</p>

<p>Cut to closeups of the pen drawing right on the glass. There&rsquo;s no lag. The pen is able to draw with a fine point. There&rsquo;s obvious pressure sensitivity. (Things you pretty much can&rsquo;t do on an iPad, but without calling it by name.) They put the pen down and &ldquo;smudge&rdquo; things with their finger.</p>

<p>Finally the art is done. The artist switches to their website and immediately publishes the work.</p>

<p>Cut to a desk with the notorious Surface keyboard and a wireless mouse right next to it. The Surface clicks in to the keyboard, sits up on the kickstand and a modern 3D PC game (say, Far Cry 4) starts up (oh yeah, it&rsquo;s got an i5 and a GPU). Display the tagline: &ldquo;Make. Publish. Play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be more interesting than breakdancing? Wouldn&rsquo;t that get you pumped up just a little bit? These days I&rsquo;m a Microsoft cynic, and that would at least get me to raise an eyebrow and <em>wish</em> my iPad could do something like that.</p>

<p>If Apple is in fact <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/01/18/kgi-apple-likely-to-sell-stylus-accessory-alongside-12-inch-ipad-pro/">working on a stylus</a> that avenue will probably close.</p>

  <p>The funny thing is that out of all Apple's products, the iPad is the one that has plateaued the most. Why are you aiming at that one?</p>
