	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In <a href="/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages">Part 1</a> I talked about my first few computers. They were an important part of my childhood, and shaped the person I would become and the career I chose. When I went to college I started to build and upgrade my own PCs. Things went well enough at first, but then got a little out of hand.</p>

<h3>Dark Ages</h3>

<p><strong>Custom PC #1</strong> (2000) Since I was still in college, I didn&rsquo;t have very much money and bought some dirt cheap parts from websites that may have been run by questionable companies. These parts were leftover from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oem">OEMs</a> and didn&rsquo;t have real retail boxes. Some would just show up with a minimal layer of bubble wrap around the bare hardware. I had bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_iii">Pentium III CPU</a>, but screwed up putting the heatsink on it. It was too unstable to run at its advertised speed, so I had to <em>underclock</em> it or it&rsquo;d just lock up the whole system within minutes. It could run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena">Quake 3</a> well enough though at that speed.</p>

<p><strong>Custom PC #2</strong> (2001) If at first you don&rsquo;t succeed right? This was the only time I strayed away from the Intel and bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd_athlon">AMD Athlon processor</a>. I had learned from my mistake and assembled it correctly, but it also had problems and would lock up at odd times. I remember trying to show my parents just what a computer could do by playing an assortment of Led Zeppelin mp3s, and halfway through Stairway it froze and needed to be restarted. I was either not a very good PC builder or kept buying crummy parts. Probably a little from column A and a little from column B.</p>

<p>I hit the nadir of my computer history while putting this computer together. During the assembly I saw that there were some weird red splotches on the inside of the case but couldn&rsquo;t figure out what they were. More started to appear and then I realized that I had cut my hand on a sharp hunk of metal from the bargain basement case and I was bleeding all over it.</p>

<h3>Working Stiff</h3>

<p><strong>Custom PC #3</strong> (2004) I had a real jobby-job and was earning more than the $Nothing I was in college, so I was finally able to afford computer parts that came in actual boxes, and wouldn&rsquo;t require keeping a roll of bandages nearby. I went back to Intel and got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_IV">Pentium 4</a> to run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_xp">Windows XP</a>. This was my first DIY computer that actually ran ok. It was also the first time I used an LCD monitor. The <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/dell-ultrasharp-1905fp/4505-3174_7-31232074.html">19&#8221; Dell Ultrasharp</a> was a big upgrade to the cumbersome CRTs I had been using.</p>

<p><strong>Custom PC #4</strong> (2007) My last Windows PC, and also the best. My brother-in-law worked at Intel and as &ldquo;payment&rdquo; for taking some pictures at his wedding gave me a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2_duo#Core_2_Duo">Core 2 Duo</a> CPU. The prior one worked well enough, but was very loud. Pentium 4&rsquo;s were known to run hot, and my case required a number of fans to keep mine from melting through to the Earth&rsquo;s core. The Core 2 Duo was much quieter.</p>

<p>Honestly, there wasn&rsquo;t anything very memorable about this one. It was a Camry â€” reliable, but otherwise unremarkable.</p>

<p>Things were starting to change for me. I had been a software developer working in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft stack</a> for a long time and felt a seven year itch to move on to different things.</p>

<h3>Fruit</h3>

<p>I never liked Apple computers. When I was growing up in the early-mid 90s, it was the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; times for Apple, when they kept releasing unremarkable computers with ancient notions of software. Even when Steve Jobs returned,  I thought of them as too expensive and fluffed up with a bunch of annoying marketing. I especially despised the original iMac<sup>1</sup> with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nS4EGKU04">goofy colors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_USB_Mouse">awful mouse</a>, and thought that it was dead in the water because it lacked a floppy drive. This wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a technical prediction of mine was hilariously off base.</p>

<p>As time went on I did start to like the industrial design of a few models. The original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4#Titanium_PowerBook_G4">Titanium Powerbooks</a> (so thin!), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_cube">G4 Cube</a> looked especially nice to my eyes, but they were still way too expensive for my budget.</p>

<p>Around the time they switched over to Intel processors I started to reconsider my position. I liked that they were <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html">Unixy</a>, making certain kinds of web development easier. Eventually, some of the more garish designs of OS X were <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/3/">stripped back</a>, and I decided to make the leap.</p>

<p>Apple recently celebrated the <a href="http://www.apple.com/30-years/">30th anniversary of the original Macintosh</a>. I joined the Mac train in 2009, and have [mostly] liked it ever since. Next time I&rsquo;ll go into the specifics of the Macs that I&rsquo;ve owned, and why I recommend them.</p>
