    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If I&rsquo;m preparing a bunch of links for a blog post or something, it&rsquo;d speed things up if I could hit a button and have the computer do everything for me. Here&rsquo;s an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html">AppleScript</a> to do just that.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">tell</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;ll copy the URL and title of the current tab in Safari as a nicely formatted <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> link. I tied that into a <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> shortcut, so that I can quickly make the link with ⌘⌥⌃C, then paste it into whichever document I&rsquo;m working in.</p>

<p>This&rsquo;ll probably work with Chrome too, but I don&rsquo;t know how much it supports AppleScript.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Family is cool and all, but really, the reason we have holidays in AMERICA is to eat too much. Here&rsquo;s how they rank. This is not opinion, it is fact.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong>. Turkey. We do it two ways, the traditional bake, and also a smoked one. Dressing/Stuffing. Potatoes. Pies (never have just one). Everything else. Part of the romanticism for Thanksgiving is also everything that goes with it: family (I happen to like mine), friends, football, cool weather, cooking, showing my kids how to cook. Leftovers are critical: More turkey, turkey soup, turkey sandwiches, more potatoes and stuffing. Here&#8217;s how much we love Thanksgiving in the Williams house: we make a second Thanksgiving meal before Christmas. Speaking of:</li>
</ol>


<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Christmas</strong>. Roast beef (garlic + rosemary). More potatoes. More Pie. Pudding.</li>
</ol>




<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Memorial Day/Independence Day/Labor Day</strong>. From a meal perspective, these are pretty much the same. Grill and/or barbecue. Beer. Diversity amongst the meat is good.</li>
</ol>




<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Octoberfest</strong>. Bratwurst on crusty rolls with sauerkraut and super grainy mustard. Beer. No it&#8217;s not a &#8220;real&#8221; holiday, congratulations on pointing that one out. You&#8217;re a regular Columbo, you are.</li>
</ol>


<ol start="50">
<li><strong>Easter</strong>. Ham. I like various pig derived food products, but baked ham just isn&#8217;t as good. Eggs are fine and I eat them all the time, but it&#8217;s hard to make them extra &#8220;special&#8221;. How often do you cook a turkey for 8 hours during the year? Compare that to eggs.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once again, the logic here is flawless. No conjecture. For realsies.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/11/thoughts-on-app-store-beta-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-11T19:37:07-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/11/thoughts-on-app-store-beta-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago Apple <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/21/rumor-testflight-owner-burstly-is-being-acquired-by-apple/">acquired the parent company</a> of <a href="http://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a> and began integrating its beta testing services into the iOS development ecosystem for iOS 8. Whenever there&rsquo;s a change to iOS there are always &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo;  and this was no exception: every app submitted as a beta still has to go through review.</p>

<p>This has been an ongoing topic on the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade">Upgrade podcast</a>. I recently submitted an update for <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/06/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/">Emergency Contacts</a> and decided to finally check this out myself. It took about 24 hours for the beta to be approved. I voiced my concern of this to the hosts:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell">@jsnell</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/imyke">@imyke</a> Took about 24 hours from time of uploading a build to it passing review for a TestFlight beta. Much too long in my opinion.</p>&mdash; Scott Williams (@swilliams) <a href="https://twitter.com/swilliams/status/530898595550339073">November 8, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://blog.swilliams.me//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And got a shout out on <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/9">episode #9</a> at the <a href="https://overcast.fm/podcasts/episode/244136329243311#t=1550">25:51 mark</a> (edited for length):</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Myke Hurley</strong> — In his opinion that&rsquo;s too long&hellip; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it that way. We&rsquo;d been previously saying &ldquo;Oh how great, 24 hours is perfectly fine.&rdquo; But, maybe you just want to get it out immediately, which is what you&rsquo;re used to. So 24 hours is 24 hours longer than 10 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Jason Snell</strong> — You get all of the extra features of that. <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/">HockeyApp</a> is still out there. The idea of Apple&rsquo;s TestFlight is that it&rsquo;s got all these other advantages going for it, including linking it to an id instead of a device id. But yeah, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it goes and if it settles down over time.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to add nuance to Twitter, so I figured I could expand on my thought here. As a developer, I value this virtuous cycle:</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img alt="Virtuous Cycle" src="http://blog.swilliams.me/images/assets/dev-virtuous-cycle.png">
</figure>


<p>When things work properly it creates a nice feedback loop and encourages me to keep going. Taking an entire day off between one of those steps resets momentum back to 0, and at least for me, momentum is huge.</p>

<p>But, like Jason said, I think Apple&rsquo;s TestFlight offers compelling advantages, especially when compared to TestFlight&rsquo;s old service. The ability to upload a build right from Xcode without having to mess around with archives and symlinks is huge. I think the UI in iTunes Connect is better too. So the $64,000 question is, Whatcha Gonna Do About It?</p>

<p>After mulling over it for a little while I think I&rsquo;ll start to switch over to Apple&rsquo;s TestFlight. In my <a href="http://swilliams.me">consulting work</a>, walking clients through the UDID process was painful and fraught with peril. I&rsquo;ll have to educate them that their builds will take a while even though I&rsquo;m &ldquo;done,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s still less of a headache than the old way.</p>

<p><a href="http://appreviewtimes.com">App review time</a> tends to get longer at certain intervals (new iPhones and Christmas), but picks back up as the staff works through the deluge of apps. I remain hopeful that beta review will follow suit.</p>

    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/07/pricing-for-emergency-contacts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pricing is tricky for mobile apps these days. When I was <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/11/06/app-number-2-emergency-contacts/">developing Emergency Contacts</a>, I knew I had a few options to choose from:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> — The app didn&rsquo;t take too long to make, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure that I wanted to just give it away for free. I thought that it had provided a modest amount of utility, so I figured that just straight up free wouldn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li><strong>Free with an In-App Purchase</strong> — I did this with <a href="http://zartbonk.com">Zartbonk</a>. But since the feature set on Emergency Contacts is pretty small, I couldn&rsquo;t think of what to lock in an extra purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Free with ads</strong> — I just don&rsquo;t like ads in apps. I didn&rsquo;t even look to see how to get this set up.</li>
<li><strong>Paid</strong> — The choice was really between free and $0.99. Since I had ruled out free, that left me here.</li>
</ul>


<p>Figuring out pricing is hard. I think I made the right choice here, though with a more complex app, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d do the same thing.</p>

</figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://emergencycontacts.org/">Emergency Contacts</a> and is available for your iOS 8 device. It&rsquo;s a real fast way to display information that might come in handy when things go bad. You can display an emergency contact, medical information, or whatever you&rsquo;d like in three rows of text. It displays as a widget on the <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-use-today-view-widgets-ios-8">Today View</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emergency-contacts-ice-widget/id931010448?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Get it now for just $0.99</a>. Read on if you want to hear the origin story.</p>

<p>The idea originated from my mother-in-law. She is new to the iPhone and asked me if there was a way to display an emergency contact, since she had something like that in her old feature-phone. Other than adding text to your wallpaper (which is pretty cheesy) I didn&rsquo;t have an answer. About an hour later it hit, <em>hey, I bet it would be real simple to put that stuff on the Today screen.</em></p>

<p>It took about 3 days of programming time, most of which was sunk by fighting with <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/10/30/dealing-with-xcode-and-swift/">Xcode+Swift issues</a>, and iOS 8 bugs<sup>1</sup>. Probably another day or so to put together a simple website and icon. Then about 4 excruciating hours of getting all the screenshots necessary for the App Store.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect this to make me rich, but felt it would be worth at least a few days of my time. I hope you like it.</p>

1. Ever wanted to hide one of the navigation buttons on a `ABPeoplePickerNavigationController`? <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5234709428699136">You used to be able to in iOS 7, not so much in 8</a>.

<p><small>
2. You have a 3.5&#8221; device, a 4&#8221; device, a 4.7&#8221; device, and a 5.5&#8221; device. And nowadays you can&#8217;t have anything in the status bar for a screenshot. You can&#8217;t just crop it out though. So, once you&#8217;ve gone to the effort of setting up the same state on 4 devices, you have to crack open Photoshop and properly airbrush out the status bar. This is extra fun when doing a Today View screenshot, because everything is nice and blurry underneath the status bar, and a giant black rectangle would be every noticeable. Even with just 2 screenshots per device, I wanted to die so bad.

    <updated>2014-10-30T10:46:09-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/10/30/dealing-with-xcode-and-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/09/10/thoughts-on-swift/">I like Swift</a>. But Xcode&rsquo;s support of Swift is&hellip; lacking (to be polite).</p>

<p>My biggest woe is that code completion up and vanishes in projects. This is especially problematic when dealing with Cocoa libraries because method names tend to be verbose and descriptive. I find myself thinking &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UINavigationController/popToRootViewControllerAnimated:">popToRoot-something-somthing</a> and was it on UIViewController or the navigationController?&rdquo;. What would&rsquo;ve taken two seconds of poking through code-completion to figure that out turned into a solid minute of searching documentation. Multiply this every time you can&rsquo;t explicitly remember every part of a method call (and spell it correctly) and tasks that normally take an hour are now a significant part of a day.</p>

<p>The tools that Apple provides are now hindering development. I&rsquo;m not alone in that sentiment. On Apple&rsquo;s developer forums (account needed to view) there are a few threads with names like <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/1067119#1067119">&ldquo;Can SourceKit possibly crash more often on a Swift project?&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/248397?start=0&amp;tstart=0">&ldquo;Xcode 6.1b3 Swift editing is becoming very difficult&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>One of those threads recommends deleting two folders: <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData</code> and <code>~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode</code>. This does the job for me. It happens often enough that I created a hot key for it with <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>.</p>

<figure class="center">
    <img alt="Keyboard Maestro Screenshot" src="http://blog.swilliams.me/images/assets/xcode-swift-maestro.png">
    <figcaption>This will yell at you if those folders don&#8217;t exist, but I can live with that.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>You could do something similar with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> or any other launcher type of app.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad that I have to create this kind of shortcut to maintain my sanity, but I remain hopeful. If Apple is betting big on Swift (and I think they are), then they&rsquo;ll <em>have</em> to improve the tool support for it.</p>

<p>X-Wing was one of my favorite games when I was a kid.</p>

<p>I played it on my <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/01/09/my-computers-through-the-ages/">family&rsquo;s rather old 386</a>. It didn&rsquo;t have a CD-ROM drive, and didn&rsquo;t really have a &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; sound card, which meant the sounds were primarily bleeps and bloops. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">Doom</a> ran if you shrank the screen size down to postage stamp dimensions. I was able to reduce the graphics quality of X-Wing enough to make it playable.</p>

<p>And play it I did. I didn&rsquo;t have a joystick, but managed to get along well enough with the mouse<sup>1</sup>. At one point I decided that I would kill every single enemy in the game that was killable. This meant hanging around after missions ended to attack the additional TIE Fighters/Bombers/Interceptors they would send after you to &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; you to wrap it up. It also meant attacking the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/EF76_Nebulon-B_escort_frigate">Frigates</a> and <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Destroyer">Star Destroyers</a>, usually by myself. I managed to pull it off in the first campaign but gave up shortly after that.</p>

<p>At some point I realized that you could have multiple accounts in the game. And those other accounts could be your wingmen in missions. So I took my best pilot, copied it several times over, then added them back to the game so that every wingman I had was at the Top Ace level.</p>

<p>TIE Fighter was also an important game for me, though by the time I got it (and a computer that would run it) I was getting ready for college and wasn&rsquo;t as obsessive as only a 14 year old Star Wars fanatic could be.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_xwing_special_edition">Both</a> <a href="http://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition">games</a> are now on sale at gog.com. I don&rsquo;t know if I have the time to go back and try to relive the glory days, but I&rsquo;m awfully tempted.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I was at a steakhouse for a company dinner. I had ordered the King of Steaks, a Rib-Eye medium rare and was looking forward to eating it. When I cut into my steak I saw that it was basically well-done (there was the tiniest sliver of pink left amidst a sea of gray). I flagged the server and said &ldquo;Um, I ordered this medium-rare&hellip;&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she apologized, grabbed the plate and went directly back to the kitchen with it. Barely five minutes later she brought back out a piping hot steak that was cooked <em>perfectly</em>. She checked back again a few minutes later to make sure everything was ok (it was).</p>

<p>Why was this so good? She knew exactly what had happened and knew how to fix it to my satisfaction. There weren&rsquo;t any games played, just immediate and decisive action.</p>

<p>I was at a hotel recently and the last day something bad happened that left a sour taste in my mouth. The manager on duty very nice and apologetic. But she asked &ldquo;What would you like me to do to &lsquo;make it right&rsquo;?&rdquo;. I hate that question because I don&rsquo;t know how to respond. Asking to comp the whole trip would be overboard and unfair. But putting the onus of the decision on me when I&rsquo;m already under duress only compounds the problem.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the service industry, you need to understand what that means and not make the customer come up with their own solutions.</p>

<p><div class="footnotes">

1. There could&rsquo;ve been a dozen reasons why my steak was overcooked, and it probably wasn&rsquo;t the server&rsquo;s fault, so there&rsquo;s no use in getting angry with her about it. The best part is that I didn&rsquo;t even have time to get angry.

<p>Swift is a new language developed by Apple. I&rsquo;ve been using for a few side projects.</p>

<p>On my first glance, I thought Swift would be a great language for beginners. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure if that&rsquo;s still the case. A beginner language should push you into a positive feedback loop: do something, see it work, do some more, and so on. Swift and Xcode 6 do some of this with aplomb, especially with playgrounds, but I found some features of the language can be frustrating until you have a deeper understanding of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Optionals are the biggest part of that. They&rsquo;re kind of crazy at first. Lot&rsquo;s of ?&rsquo;s and !&rsquo;s running around. When I was starting with Swift, Xcode would constantly complain that I was missing one. Sometimes it would tell me which one was missing, but sometimes it didn&rsquo;t. After reading the documentation a little more and thinking about it, things started to click. Handling nil values is important in any language, and handling them poorly can lead to some truly marvelous bugs or security issues. Swift makes you face them much earlier in the process. I think this is a good thing, though it can make for a frustrating start. It&rsquo;s also made me think if I&rsquo;m handling nils properly in other languages I use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working on my own personal style, but I think I should be using more computed properties. A rule I&rsquo;m toying with is to keep on making methods for &ldquo;verbs&rdquo; like <code>moveFileToThing</code>, but use properties for &ldquo;nouns&rdquo; like <code>allSampleAssets</code>, even if that property makes several other calls within its implementation. This might require renaming certain methods in order to better comply with that style; if <code>allSampleAssets</code> took a <code>sort</code> parameter it couldn&rsquo;t be a property, so I&rsquo;d rename it to <code>queryAllSampleAssets(sort: NSSortDescriptor)</code>.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s a brand new thing, there is still a good amount of Objective C and Cocoa baggage. The standard collections use <code>AnyObject</code> where <code>id</code> used to be, which means you&rsquo;ll need to do some explicit casting to the type you need. I found it easier when dealing with an <code>NSDictionary</code> or <code>NSArray</code> to not try to cram all the casting and then manipulating into a single line of code.</p>

<p>Enums have reams of power that could be used for evil. I like the way <a href="http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/130-swift-json-redux-part-1">NSScreencasts uses enums with JSON parsing</a>, but it&rsquo;s hard to comprehend. If you have more of a functional programming background, I suspect this would be easier.</p>

<p>Swift is going to be huge. I think Apple does have a language on its hands that&rsquo;ll last for its next 20 years. There are still some rough edges and potential pitfalls, but It has become the language I prefer when creating iOS apps.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-07T14:23:14-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/09/07/a-trip-to-joshua-tree-and-back</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>[Editor&rsquo;s note: the author will try not to make any terrible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joshua_Tree">U2</a> jokes, but no guarantees, k?]</em></p>

<p>On drive back from visiting my grandfather in Palm Springs, I started to notice a few interesting spots right off of I-10. I got to thinking that even though I&rsquo;ve driven that stretch of road dozens of times I&rsquo;ve never seen what&rsquo;s just down the various exits. When I got home I asked a friend if he wanted to go with me on an adventure, we set a date and went off.</p>

<p>I decided that I didn&rsquo;t have enough stress on my wallet and rented an amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LAJQVR6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00LAJQVR6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=SXRLLGQXQE6EXCZV">Nikon D800</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037KM0X0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0037KM0X0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=WKK5Q3JEYBRTBVUG">lens</a> to go with it.</p>

<p>I was blown away by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range">dynamic range</a> of the D800. I thought I&rsquo;d appreciate the step in quality over my older D300, but wow! I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to use a <a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/why-i-moved-to-medium-format-phase-one-iq140-review/">medium format setup</a>, but I think I understand just how much of a jump in quality a larger sensor size can make.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s our journey.</p>

<h3>Salome Rd, North off I-10</h3>

<figure>
    <img alt="Shed" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1300.jpg">
    <figcaption>Some kind of utility shed off of Salome Rd</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Cactus" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1313.jpg">
    <figcaption>I&#8217;m not totally sold on the value of having a maximum aperture of f/1.4 on a 24mm lens, but this cactus demonstrates that it can look pretty. Also further down Salome Rd, then Eagle Eye Rd.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Out Past Blythe</h3>

<figure>
    <img alt="No Hunting" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1343.jpg">
    <figcaption>Blythe is a town that people usually stop in for lunch on their way to California or Arizona. We decided to see what&#8217;s out on the roads that go beyond the fast food.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Rusted Car" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1370.jpg">
    <figcaption>According to Apple Maps, Lovekin Rd is supposed to go all the way up to Highway 62. I&#8217;m sure it does, but at about 3/4&#8217;s of the way it becomes a private road and is no longer paved. This rusted out hulk was about 100 yards away from the end.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Storm and Desert Center</h3>

<figure>
    <img alt="Storm Comin'" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1374.jpg">
    <figcaption>Back on I-10. We saw a big weather system moving in and managed to get onto an overpass before it hit us.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Decay" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1383.jpg">
    <figcaption><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Center,_California">Desert Center</a> is what gave me the idea to do this trip in the first place. Most of the town looks abandoned, and yields some pretty interesting photo locations.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Family Cafe" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1392.jpg">
    <figcaption>It was pouring at this point, but I did manage to run out in the rain long enough to grab this.</figcaption>

    <img alt="Old Gas Pump" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1402.jpg">
    <figcaption>Next to the café was an ancient gas station. Each of the pumps were in various stages of decay.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>A little west of of the cafe was a group of pre-fabricated houses, kind of like what you&#8217;d see from Habitat for Humanity. All of them were basically destroyed from neglect and looked like a refuge for squatters.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Tagged" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1428.jpg">
    <figcaption>All of them were vandalized too.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>To escape the weather we headed north from Desert Center up Highway 177. In the distance you could see the dust blowing against the mountains.</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3>Joshua Tree Park</h3>

<p>I finally found what I was looking for. <em>[ed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EabB55IYyOg">Argh!</a> You were warned.]</em></p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1464.jpg">
    <figcaption>Joshua Trees are interesting. They look like palms trees, but with multiple heads.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1473.jpg">
    <figcaption>This is the Dynamic Range I was talking about. The sun is literally right behind the tree, but you can still make out plenty of detail in the shadows.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Fat caterpillar" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1505.jpg">
    <figcaption>We also found lot&#8217;s of fat caterpillars. This guy looked like he was getting ready to do the chrysalis thing.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Jumbo Rocks" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1515.jpg">
    <figcaption>If you like bouldering or climbing rocks, this would be the place for you. After this trip, I want to return and camp there to be able to explore all of its crannies.</figcaption>
</figure>




<figure>
    <img alt="Joshua Tree" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1522.jpg">
    <figcaption>By this point I was coming up with various schemes to justify keeping the D800.</figcaption>

<h3>Coming Home</h3>

<figure>
    <img alt="My Scion" src="http://swilliams.me/static/photos/joshua-tree/800_1545.jpg">
    <figcaption>We drove <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/04/20/in-which-i-purchased-a-new-car/">my car</a> The way out of the park back down to I-10 was filled corners and S-curves. Needless to say, I loved it.</figcaption>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PED&rsquo;s are one of the long-time kerfuffles in sports. I had a thought about how to solve that controversy the other day.</p>

<p>First, embrace PEDs. Stop suspending athletes for taking them and make everything public. <em>Just pay them less.</em> If PEDs make the game easier for them, don&rsquo;t pay them as much.</p>

<p>Next, encourage Performance <em>Detractors</em> by paying athletes more for using them. If a linebacker can make 15 sacks while on 20mg of Valium, he should be paid more. You could have a whole range.</p>

<ul>
<li>-50% for the horse steroids used by the East Germans in the 80s</li>
<li>-30% for the Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s Blood Doping Special</li>
<li>-20% for all the Biogensis type stuff</li>
<li>-1% for Ibuprofen</li>
<li>Control group. No drugs at all.</li>
<li>+10% Marijuana</li>
<li>+20% Benzodiazepines</li>
<li>+40% LSD</li>

    <link href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/08/12/porting-db5-to-swift/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-12T16:41:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/08/12/porting-db5-to-swift</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of using the <a href="https://github.com/quartermaster/DB5">DB5 library</a> for customizing an iOS app via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plist">plist configuration file</a>, and I&rsquo;ve used it in several projects so far. I&rsquo;ve also  been digging more into Swift and iOS 8 and thought it would be a good exercise to familiarize myself more with Swift to port DB5 from its original Objective C codebase to Swift.</p>

<p>The result is over on Github: <a href="https://github.com/swilliams/DB5-Swift">DB5-Swift</a>.</p>

<p>For grins, I wanted to go with a purely Swift approach, no NSWhatever classes unless there was no alternative. This meant using <code>Dictionary</code> instead of <code>NSDictionary</code>. Which turned into a bit of a headache. The biggest issue I ran into was that Swift&rsquo;s Dictionary doesn&rsquo;t seem to have an equivalent of NSDictionary&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000140-CBHBABID"><code>initWithContentsOfFile:</code></a><sup>1</sup>. Rather than try to parse the plist by hand, I just went back with good ole NSDictionary.</p>

<p>Two of Swift&rsquo;s headlining features are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_468">type inference</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_478">optional values</a>. I&rsquo;ve used both of these features before in C# for several years and have appreciated what they bring to the table. Swift is a little bit different though because it comes with the history of Objective C and Cocoa. NSDictionary was built to take advantage of Objective C&rsquo;s type system, and using it with Swift involved more casting and ? and ! operators than I expected. It didn&rsquo;t help that Xcode would often be wrong in its helper tooltips, suggesting addtional !&rsquo;s which wouldn&rsquo;t fix the problem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if DB5-Swift is 100% up to snuff right now. I think some of the methods should have better handling for nil values. I still have plenty of learning left before I&rsquo;d consider myself adept at Swift. Overall, it was  a good exercise, and I will use it in future apps.</p>

    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/07/10/naming-your-stuff</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Names are hard, especially for a framework or library. A good name is memorable, and can be a shot in the arm in terms of discoverability. Finding a good name is nebulous, and too often falls into the I&rsquo;ll-know-it-when-I-see-it category. But a <em>bad</em> name is easier to define. The biggest sin of bad names is that they are impossible to find answers when you run into questions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to throw rocks at somebody else&rsquo;s hard work, but I think it&rsquo;s been enough time that I can gently criticize the name of the <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype JavaScript library</a><sup>1</sup>. Why was this a bad name? Well, what do you do when you run into a problem that isn&rsquo;t quickly found in the official documentation? Search for it on Google. Now, the term <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype">&ldquo;prototype&rdquo; is a core part of the JavaScript language</a>, which meant that every single search result for &ldquo;prototype X&rdquo;, &ldquo;JavaScript prototype X&rdquo;, &ldquo;prototype js X&rdquo; or any other combination only referred to dealing with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">prototypal inheritance in JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>You may be the biggest fan of both The Simpsons and Ruby. Don&rsquo;t name your library &ldquo;Homer&rdquo;. Again, what happens if someone runs into a problem when using Homer? They&rsquo;re going to try to search for &ldquo;homer fix json serialization&rdquo; and get a bunch of funnier Simpsons quotes. Your JSON parsing library is never going to be more popular than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khSIYmTzt6U">Mr. Simpson</a>, so please, pick something else.</p>

<p>Common words aren&rsquo;t necessarily bad. <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a>, and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> are all fairly common English words, but none of them are common enough to pollute search results. Spend a few minutes searching around before putting together your splash page.</p>

1. In the war between Prototype and jQuery, I was in the former&rsquo;s camp for a long time. Prototype seemed like magic back in 2006 when I was coding AJAX manually. Searching for jQuery issues was never a problem though.

    <link href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/07/07/friction-and-teams/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-07T15:23:47-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/07/07/friction-and-teams</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Developers tend to plow through the path of least resistance. Any amount of friction they encounter tends to be routed over or around. For example, I&rsquo;ve worked at a place where Sharepoint was the mandated document storage for the company. The problem is that Sharepoint is awful and unless it was setup by experts, difficult to find what you&rsquo;re looking for.<sup>1</sup> Since it was so convoluted, developers ignored it.</p>

<p>This lead to bigger problems. A sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition">oral tradition</a> was inadvertently created and persisted. Since developers were ignoring documentation, requirements were missed and features were implemented incorrectly. Fingers were pointed and words were exchanged.</p>

<p>Now, imagine for a moment you were the manager in charge of this lot and suddenly found out that your document system was completely ignored by everyone on your team. Bad managers try to correct this with the heavy-handed approach and enforce the IT policy. I&rsquo;ve seen this happen and it isn&rsquo;t pretty. It usually results in the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166626/divine-right-of-kings">Divine Right of Management</a> being invoked, and then rapidly returns to status quo when said manager is not looking.</p>

<p>What should you do instead? Keeping that convoluted game of telephone doesn&rsquo;t work, and erects huge barriers for any new person. <a href="http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Pave_the_Cowpaths">Paving the cowpaths</a> may not necessarily be the best approach either because it could cement bad practices<sup>2</sup>. Anarchy is not a reliable cowpath.</p>

<p>Being a good manager is about removing the friction from your team to enable them to do good work. What&rsquo;s the friction in the above scenario? Dealing with a crummy document management system. How do you remove that? One team I&rsquo;ve worked with used a Github based workflow for source code and started using the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis">wikis</a> on Github. Another place used Trello, which required more management, but it was still easy to look stuff up. Heck, you could even have an expert come over and wrestle Sharepoint into being manageable.</p>

<p>Like everything else, there isn&rsquo;t a silver bullet here. In fact, so-called silver bullets tend to create these scenarios (all of the bullet points on the box sure looked good to somebody in a position of authority). A good manager will know their team and understand where these points of friction occur. It might be impossible to smooth them over entirely, but every single bit you can scrape away will only make your team more productive.</p>

<p>I bought a new camera a little while ago, and finally had the opportunity to put it through its paces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20&amp;linkId=2PJ4FLG2K25KQBDP">The Fujifilm X100s</a> isn&rsquo;t particularly cheap, so I saved a while to be able to afford it, but so far I&rsquo;m really liking it.</p>

<p>I have three Nikon DSLRs and an assortment of nice lenses to go with them, so why would I want a smaller, almost Point and Shoot camera? For starters, it&rsquo;s much smaller. I love my Nikons, but carrying around a backpack has never been <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2013/09/04/you-probably-shouldnt-buy-a-dslr/">convenient</a>, especially when you need to take a shot fast. It can fit in a large pocket, and I have a belt-style pouch for it too. Its lens is fixed at about the equivalent of 35mm on an SLR. You&rsquo;d think being stuck at a single focal length would be an issue, but it&rsquo;s a good size for when its use cases (informal portraits, walking around, &ldquo;street&rdquo; photography). Oh yeah, and the pictures that come out of it are gorgeous.</p>

<p>Where doesn&rsquo;t it stand up very well? When you need to get closer. When you need the absolute <em>best</em> image quality. When you need a high frame-rate of shots (sports). I wouldn&rsquo;t shoot a wedding with just the X100s, but it would be very useful for wandering around during the reception.</p>

<p>Despite those issues, this is probably my go to camera for 80% of my needs right now. If it had been available 10 years ago when I was considering a DSLR purchase, I might&rsquo;ve gone with this instead.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-12T13:16:18-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/05/12/how-i-started-to-understand-model-binding-magic-in-ember</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m learning <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> in efforts to stay <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/01/20/keep-your-developer-saw-sharp/">reasonably up to date</a> with client side web technologies. <a href="http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/05/06/oh-cool-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer/">This hasn&rsquo;t been the easiest going.</a></p>

<p>Ember&rsquo;s best feature is that it easily binds values in HTML to their corresponding properties on objects. I&rsquo;ve found the implementations of this a little confusing sometimes. Going through the Getting Started guide has been helpful, though <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/displaying-the-number-of-incomplete-todos/">this part tripped</a> me up for a good hour, specifically this snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Within todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That last line turns the associatied method into a <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/computed-properties/">computed property</a>.  My understanding of computed properties was as a means to provide a simple call to complex data (eg. a <code>fullName</code> property that joins <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> properties). This particular method is on a <em>controller</em>, has a previously foreign syntax (<code>@each</code>), and the template that refers to it still uses it&rsquo;s canonical name (<code>remaining</code>).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="http://blog.swilliams.me/images/assets/ember/zoidberg.gif" alt="Wha?" />
</figure>


<p>In order to understand just what was happening, I pumped the brakes and dug into the sample application. My first question was why they were using a computed property altogether. I whipped up another method and added it to my controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">remaining</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;@each.isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>index.html</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>todos {{derp}}<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This resulted in the method body being substituted in the template, which reminded me that <code>{{derp}}</code> was just printing out whatever <code>derp</code> evaluated to, in this case a function.<sup>1</sup> So I made <code>derp</code> a computed property:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;derp!&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;what&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This worked. My <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was now &lsquo;todos derp!&rsquo;. In fact, you could simplify it even more by doing this: <code>property()</code> and leaving off a name altogether. It also demonstrated that the first argument to <code>property</code> didn&rsquo;t have a bearing on what goes in the Template. Next step was to substitute my static text with something useful.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>todos_controller.js </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">derp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">filterBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;isCompleted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;length&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}.</span><span class="nx">property</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And sure enough, the title was now &lsquo;todos 2&rsquo;. I suspected this would work because my controller extended <code>Ember.ArrayController</code>, giving it access to <code>filterBy</code>. This lead me back to one of my original questions: what is the purpose of <code>'@each.isCompleted'</code>?</p>

<p>I played around with the todo app a little more and noticed that my <code>{{derp}}</code> was not automatically updating when todos where checked off while the original <code>{{remaining}}</code> was. Then it hit me: <code>'@each'</code> must be a special directive for an <code>ArrayController</code> that bound that function to the <code>isCompleted</code> property of <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.ArrayController.html#property__each"><em>each</em></a> object in its array. Putting a <code>console.log('called');</code> confirmed this suspicion — it&rsquo;s called every time <code>isCompleted</code> is accessed.</p>

<p>After this bit of forensics, things make a little more sense now. I do wish this association was a little more spelled out in the documentation though for us thick-headed developers.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-06T14:49:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.swilliams.me/words/2014/05/06/what-is-app-dot-net</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people who have even heard of it would say that it&rsquo;s a Twitter clone, created out of <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/what-twitter-could-have-been">frustrations over the direction it was heading</a>. Currently, the <a href="http://app.net">home page</a> makes it look like an identity and/or messaging service. Over the last couple years, it&rsquo;s bounced around and offered different services. According to the founders, the <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">genesis</a> of it was to create a backend-as-a-service to enable developers to make the next generation of online applications.</p>

<p>The problem was that I don&rsquo;t think App.net ever moved beyond the shadow of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Twitter clone.&rdquo; App.net&rsquo;s API does offer the capabilities to make some really <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">slick</a> <a href="http://favd.net/">apps</a>, but there hasn&rsquo;t been any one thing that captured everyone&rsquo;s attention to make them say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; There is the <a href="https://alpha.app.net/">microblogging service</a>, the <a href="https://omega.app.net/">messaging service</a>, the <a href="https://broadcast.app.net">broadcast service</a>, the <a href="https://backer.app.net/">crowdfunding service</a> and <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/">the cloud storage service</a>. If you&rsquo;re being unkind, you could call them the Twitter clone, the iMessage clone, the Push Notification clone, the Kickstarter clone, and the Dropbox clone. Each of those services are good, but none of them have differentiated themselves from their biggest competitors. If all of those went dark tomorrow, everybody would be able to move back to what they were using before without too much trouble.</p>

<p>There was a great initial fervor when App.net launched. Some big names supported it both vocally and financially. Unfortunately, their engagement petered out over time. The most damning evidence of this? Out of all the people on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801133202/https://join.app.net/">this page</a> the only person who still interacts on App.net regularly is <a href="https://alpha.app.net/garrytan">Garry Tan</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>I was very bullish on App.net, which makes the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/">latest news</a> saddening. It isn&rsquo;t the end yet, but when you have literally no employees working on a service and suspend the biggest <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">incentive to develop on your platform</a>, it isn&rsquo;t too far away. Right now the best case I see for App.net is
that it continues along as is, but with little to no growth. I did renew my paid account this year, but I don&rsquo;t know if the service will be around for another renewal next time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like armchair quarterbacking. Saying what <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/woman-a-leading-authority-on-what-shouldnt-be-in-p,35922/">should have been done</a> is too easy and requires no effort on my part. I do think that a lesson to take away from this is that identity is important and needs to be clear to customers.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
1. It looks like <a href="https://alpha.app.net/peterrojas">Peter Rojas</a> and <a href="https://alpha.app.net/andrewchen">Andrew Chen</a> have feeds that syndicate to App.net. Nobody else on that list had any kind of post within the last month.

<p>And as pointed out by <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chriskrycho/post/29913830">Chris Krycho</a>, it looks like Garry&#8217;s posts are just cross-posted from Twitter using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>.</p>
