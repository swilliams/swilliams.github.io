<a href="/"></a>Read a pretty great post over by <a href="http://chrisashworth.org/blog/2010/06/24/my-competitive-advantage-i-hire-artists/">Chris Ashworth</a>, &quot;My Competitive Advantage: I Hire Artists&quot;<p /><div>The gist is that an &quot;artist&quot; as he describes it, is the kind of person who is truly passionate about something. The example provided is that the artist in question turned down a significantly higher salary at a stable job in order to work for the author. Choice quotes:</div> <p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> &quot;[He] is the kind of guy that uses QLab like a musical instrument. I couldn&#39;t keep up with him if I tried. He makes things in QLab I didn&#39;t even know were possible. AND I WROTE IT.&quot;</blockquote><p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> &quot;But for many (all?) of the best people in the world, money stops mattering once you have enough to not worry about it.&quot;</blockquote><p /><div>At least for me, the word &quot;artist&quot; has conotated someone who was tempermental, lazy, and pretentious. And I think that for a large number of so-called &quot;artists&quot; this is true. But I think the true ones are as Chris describes: </div> <p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> &quot;Artists, as a species, are amazing people... Show me a good artist and I will show you a highly educated, highly creative, highly passionate, highly driven human being.&quot;</blockquote><p /><div> </div>
