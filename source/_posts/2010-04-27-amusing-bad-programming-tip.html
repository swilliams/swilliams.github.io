<p>Say you have a class with a property that's a <span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">string</span>. Using object initializers you can do this little nugget:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<div>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Product p = new Product { ProductName = Console.ReadLine() };</pre></div>
</div>

</div>
<p />
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It will work as you'd expect (prompt you for input, then assign it to </span><span style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">ProductName)</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">. <em>However</em>, that's pretty easy to miss when you're quickly scanning code. I'm generally in favor of fewer lines of code, but in this case it would be good design to just break this into two lines.</span></p>
