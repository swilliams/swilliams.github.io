<p>I tend to yo-yo on my feelings with Tesla motors. This video <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/07/tesla-plant-video/">(and article)</a> of the Tesla plant hits all the right spots in my nerd brain: technology, robots, nice cars. And it passed the 5 year old test ("Can we watch it again Daddy?") too. </p><div class="intrinsic" style="max-width:100%"><div class="embed-block-wrapper" style="padding-bottom:56.20609%;"><div class="sqs-video-wrapper" data-html="&lt;iframe width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/8_lfxPI5ObM?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" data-provider-name="YouTube"><div class="sqs-video-overlay" style="opacity: 0;"><img data-src="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8_lfxPI5ObM/hqdefault.jpg" data-load="false" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" /><div class="sqs-video-opaque"></div><div class="sqs-video-icon"></div></div></div></div></div><p>I like Tesla cars quite a bit. If I had a spare $60-70k to burn on a car, I just might get a Model S. </p>

<p>Which is why I find it particularly frustrating when they pull marketing like this. </p><img src="/images/assets/Tesla.png" /><p>That $580 isn't as low as it once was, but the snake oil in that ad has already been covered by <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/04/02/the-strange-maths-of-teslas-500month-model-s/">plenty of others</a>. If you need a 3 line asterisk to describe the "true cost of ownership" of your product, your message might be a little muddled. The cars could <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1301_2013_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_tesla_model_s/viewall.html">practically market themselves</a>, but the leadership of the company seems to think it's not enough and stoops to this level.</p>

<p>These things seem at odds with each other, but I think there is a line to walk. I can like the cars/engineering/tech for what they are, and try to close my eyes when their marketing goes bananas. It's not like I have a vote in the situation, democratically or dollar-wise, anyway. (Plus, rooting for brands is just dumb.) </p>
