I'm using the awesome&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a>&nbsp;plugin in my&nbsp;<a href="swilliams">rails app</a>. One of the great selling points for it is that it will automatically resize images and create thumbnails for them. To do this, it needs the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a>&nbsp;library installed.<p /><div>No worries, I headed over to their site and saw that the "best" way to install it is via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macports.org/">mac ports</a>, a package manager similar to&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">Debian's apt</a>, but for OS X.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>So I headed over there, and downloaded the 100k installer for that. Only to see that it needed XCode as a dependency, roughly a 1 GB install.</div><p /><div><i>sigh</i></div><p /><div>So, I broke out the system DVD and installed XCode. And then mac ports. And then ImageMagick. Just so that I could resize an image programatically.&nbsp;</div>
