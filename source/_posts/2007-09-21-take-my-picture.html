<p>An interesting [to me anyway] observation - When asking someone to take a picture of me with my camera:
</p>
<p><strong>4 years ago - With a point & shoot</strong> - Now, it's digital so just look at the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Today - With an SLR</strong> - No, you have to look through the viewfinder. No really, that screen is going to stay black. Yes, like a <em>real</em> camera.</p>
