<p>Spurred on by a <a href="https://twitter.com/swilliams/status/420395505852506112">Twitter conversation</a>, I figured I'd write more about my thoughts on the subject over here. I've always wanted a GOOD photo editor on the iPad, ever since I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fk1V5NqoD4&amp;list=PLPlyGeI5oeICPGwwp4HTdNZkpyP0flmhC">demo</a> of the very first one. There have been a few contendors, but they've all fallen short. </p>

<p>iPhoto is supposed to be this solution, but the workflow is aggravating. I'd love to take a picture on my iPhone, pull up my iPad and edit that picture on the bigger screen, then send it back to my phone (or elsewhere). But there's a lag while iCloud syncs, and then somehow I end up with 4 duplicates when I'm done editing, and another lag while iCloud syncs again, <em>sigh</em>.</p>

<p>I've toyed with the idea of doing it, but it'd be pretty hard, and time consuming. If anyone is feeling particularly up for a challenge, here's how I'd do it.</p>

<p><strong>Pair with a camera.</strong> Speaking of hard, here we go. DSLR's <em>still</em> don't have built-in wifi, and neither do most point and shoots<sup>1</sup>. But if someone does have the appropriate adapter, it'd be killer. Bonus points for setting up some kind of ad hoc wifi network for a camera to connect to, if that's even possible. If no direct camera connection is possible, then also have the option of getting the images from a computer, once they've been downloaded there.</p>

<p><strong>Display photos as soon as they are taken.</strong> When I press the shutter, the photo should appear on the iPad within moments. Since photos (especially RAW) can be huge, this'll have to be a temporary buffer. If I start to edit a photo, hang onto it, otherwise just keep the last 10 or so around in memory on the iPad. I should be able to swipe through all of the photos in the buffer.</p>

<p><strong>Give me some decent editing tools.</strong> Obviously you wouldn't need to add the featureset of Photoshop, but a certain subset would be great:</p>

<ul>
<li>RAW controls (temperature/tint, exposure, blacks, brightness, etc)</li>
<li>Curves</li>
<li>Black &amp; White manipulation</li>
<li>"Real" filters, based on the above controls. We already have Instagram, and don't need another way to make a photo look like it was a Polaroid from the 70's. Heck, let me make my own filters.</li>
<li>Basic touch-ups, kinda like Lightroom (smooth skin, eye brightness, etc). Imagine being able to draw a brightness correction with just your finger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simple export.</strong> This might be a problem on iOS. Don't draw my ire like iPhoto and its syncing woes. Avoid photos.app until the very end when I <em>want</em> to put a picture in there. Maybe have a companion app for OS X and send a photo there directly from the iPad and avoid the photos app altogether (and save space).</p>

<p>You could whip through that workflow quickly, and not have to fiddle with a mouse and bloated software, or iCloud lag.</p>

1. I think the camera manufacturers have a secret death wish. You can buy a smartphone with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COYOAYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00COYOAYW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">pretty decent camera, GPS, and wifi built in for $129</a>, but not a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006U49XM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006U49XM6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thepetzoo-20">$6500 dSLR</a>.
