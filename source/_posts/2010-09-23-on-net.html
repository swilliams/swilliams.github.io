I don&#39;t think my feelings are quite to this extreme, but I definitely sympathize with the tone <a href="http://whatupdave.tumblr.com/post/1170718843/leaving-net">presented here</a>. Money quote:<p /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> The real answer is of course “STOP USING SO MANY ILL-CONCEIVED ABSTRACTIONS AND LEARN FROM YOUR PEERS HOW THE #@$#@% WEB WORKS!”.</blockquote>
