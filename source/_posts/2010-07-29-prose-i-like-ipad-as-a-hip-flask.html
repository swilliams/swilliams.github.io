From Paul Graham's latest essay,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html">"The Acceleration of Addictiveness"</a><p /><div><blockquote type="cite"><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: small;">Several people have told me they like the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip flask.</span></blockquote><br /></div><div>The whole essay is worth a read, though that footnote is probably my favorite.</div>
