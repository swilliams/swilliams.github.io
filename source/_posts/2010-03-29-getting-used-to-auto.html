Something that I&#39;ve noticed in certain photographic forums is a bit of a snobbery when it comes to the preferred mode a person&#39;s camera is in. There seems to be a prevailing notion that Manual is the One True Mode for a camera, and everything else is for &quot;noobs&quot;.<p /><div>I used to feel this way, but in my own recent work, I have started to use Aperture priority and even Auto-ISO more and more, and have been incredibly happy with the results. In fact, when I&#39;m not shooting with flash, or in dim lighting, In fact, you could state that I&#39;m getting close to using the easy settings all of the time.</div> <p /><div>I will make this claim though: if you are a <b>beginner-</b> <a href="/images/assets/#img to +1.0 to <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml">expose to the right</a>.</div> <p /><div>Most recently, I&#39;ve been using Auto-ISO as well. This was pretty limited on my D50, and I imagine this is still the case on newer amateur oriented cameras as well. But, on the D300, this works swimmingly because it can be configured in detail. I can set the minimum shutter speed I want to use, and tell it to not go higher than ISO 1600. Thus when it is detecting that I&#39;m not getting the shutter speed I need, it bumps the ISO up just a little bit. It&#39;s not uncommon to see an ISO of something like 250 or 900 in this range. </div> <p /><div>With these settings I can pull the camera up to my eye and start shooting immediately in most situations. And yes, if I need to really fine tune an image, I can still quickly jump to M mode and tweak away.</div> <p /><div>Photography is about capturing moments, and if I&#39;m fiddling with dials I might miss that moment.</div><p /><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. Nor am I a pro, but I do know a few things.</span></div>
