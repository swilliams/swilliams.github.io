Alright, I&#39;m going to try to avoid slipping into Rant Mode here.<p /><div>Apple just announced their newest super gizmo, the <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad</a>. Like the iPhone, iPod, and pretty much every other mobile device, it does not have a front facing video camera to allow video chat. Of course, a certain subset of people really wish it did, and continually whine about said lack. But do you know why it doesn&#39;t have video chat?</div> <p /><div><i>Because video chat on a mobile device just doesn&#39;t work.</i></div><p /><div>Here&#39;s how I know: Take your phone. Now, hold it out in front of you in a position that you think would be fitting for a video chat. Keep holding it there, and be steady; no shaking. Keep holding. Try it for just 30 seconds. Is your arm tired yet?</div> <p /><div>There simply is no way to comfortably hold something like a phone out in front of you without support. You could hold it lower and try to support your arm with your body at the elbow (like a normal phone), but then your chat buddy will get a good look at what is currently up your nose.</div> <p /><div>The iPad could work with a stand/dock, but in that situation, it&#39;s not really <i>mobile</i> is it?</div>
