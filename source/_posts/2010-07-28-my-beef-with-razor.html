<div><span style="font-size: x-small;">(Note, for non-programmers, this is </span><i><span style="font-size: x-small;">not</span></i><span style="font-size: x-small;"> about shaving)</span></div> <p /><a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> MVC has <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/27/introducing-asp-net-mvc-3-preview-1.aspx">shipped the first preview of version 3</a>. This is a good thing, mostly. By default it will be using the brand spanking new <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx">Razor</a> view engine... and I&#39;m having a hard time trying to figure out why it&#39;s even in there.<p /><div>The <i>raison d&#39;être</i> for Razor is to allow for less code in the Views. This too, is a good thing. But I just don&#39;t think it does <i>enough</i>. Here&#39;s one of the samples provided:</div><p /><div><div>@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage</div><p /> <div>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</div><p /><div>&lt;html&gt;</div> <div>&lt;head&gt;</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="">	</span>&lt;title&gt;@View.Title&lt;/title&gt;</div> <div>&lt;/head&gt;</div><div>&lt;body&gt;</div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="">	</span>@RenderBody()</div> <div>&lt;/body&gt;</div><div>&lt;/html&gt;</div></div><p /><div>It <i>is</i> nice that you don&#39;t need a gigantic header any more, and I like that the masterpage syntax is a little slimmer, but in general all you&#39;re saving are a bunch of &lt;%= %&gt; tags. That&#39;s nice, but is that really that great of an improvement to warrant an entirely new ViewEngine? Am I missing something important here? Especially once you get into non-trivial pages with hundreds of tags and template syntax.</div> <p /><div>What I think would have been awesome would be to use the reduced &lt;%= %&gt; footprint but also incorporate something like NHaml, which would <i>really</i> minimize the code footprint.</div>
