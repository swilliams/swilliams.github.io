I&#39;m kind of on the fence with Facebook. On the one hand, it let&#39;s me share news, pictures, and information very easily with friends and family. On the other, it&#39;s run by people who are either incompetent or outright malicious with their practices. Just read a couple of these articles to find out just how they feel about your data (some articles contain R-rated language, mom):<div> <ul><li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5">Business Insider</a></li><li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-has-recently-been-displaying-a-disregard-bordering-on-disdain-for-facebook-users-privacy-2010-5">More Business Insider</a> </li> <li><a href="http://calacanis.com/2010/05/12/the-big-game-zuckerberg-and-overplaying-your-hand/">Jason Calacanis</a> (whom I normally can&#39;t stand, but offers insightful information here)</li><li><a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline">The EFF</a> on their slowly eroding privacy policy.</li> </ul></div><div>This stuff seems pretty bad, especially the cavalier attitude their CEO has with regards to privacy. The crazy part is: they do not have any reason to change. Over 35 million people check their Facebook pages at least once a day (I&#39;m one of them). So unless they take a significant hit in the pocketbook, why would they change?</div> <p /><div>I&#39;m not calling for a boycott here, that&#39;s just a little silly. And Facebook does still provide a useful utility; there just isn&#39;t a better way for me to keep up with my circle of friends out there. However, I am careful with what is on my Facebook. I don&#39;t install any apps or games, I monitor my privacy settings every little while or so, and I don&#39;t use status updates for anything serious.<br /> <p /><div>So use Facebook, and have fun, but exercise some caution. Do not post <i><b>anything</b></i> on it that you wouldn&#39;t mind having shouted from a megaphone to the entire planet. </div></div>
