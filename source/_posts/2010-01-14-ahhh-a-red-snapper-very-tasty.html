We went there last night, and I ordered the Aji sashimi (it&#39;s actually a Mackerel, but I just like the title). It came with the body of the fish artfully arranged with the sashimi. The sashimi itself was quite good, however when I was done, the waitress came by, took the plate, and said she was going to &quot;fry it up&quot; for me. I wasn&#39;t paying that much attention so I just nodded.<p /><div>After she disappeared to the kitchen I actually processed what she said. Fry up the fish... <i>head</i>? And fins? And tail? Hmmm. Eventually she brought it back, and yes, what was left was definitely deep fried. I girded up my loins and actually ate most of it. Apparently the Aji has soft bones, because I was able to just chomp right on through. That last sentence might be a little squeamish for some folks.</div> <p /><div>I didn&#39;t eat the head (or eyeball) though... as Shawn said, you have to draw the line somewhere.</div> <p></p>
