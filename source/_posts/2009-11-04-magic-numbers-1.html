In programming, it is generally a good idea to avoid &quot;magic numbers&quot; meaning a number that could change with requirements:<p /><div>if (foo &lt; 3) { do something }</div> <p /><div>That 3 could change, or it&#39;s meaning could be lost. A good practice is to define a variable for that magic number with an intelligent name (and possibly store the number in some configuration).</div> <p /><div>const int maxWidgets = 3;</div><div>if (foo &lt; maxWidgets) { do something }<p /> </div><div>I did recently see a bit of code that got the concept, but failed in the execution:</div><p /><div>const int THREE = 3;</div> <div>if (foo &lt; THREE) { do something }</div><p /><div>It is possible that the maximum number of widgets might change to 10. Then you&#39;re stuck with this brilliant bit of code:</div> <p /><div>const int THREE = 10;</div><p /><div>Uh oh.Â </div>
