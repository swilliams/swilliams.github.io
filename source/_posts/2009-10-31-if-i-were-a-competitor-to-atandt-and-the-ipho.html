<p>I'd cull almost my entire line of phones and have: <p /> <ol>
<li>A couple of freebie or dirt cheap phones (one candybar, one slider, etc)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Invest heavily in Android on everything else, and hire some good developers to make high quality apps for it. Especially apps that Apple won't approve.</li>
</ol></p>
