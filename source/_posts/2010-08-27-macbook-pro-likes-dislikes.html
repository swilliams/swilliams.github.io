About a month ago I picked up the basic 13&quot; MacBook Pro. My primary intent was that I needed a non-Windows portable for rails development<span style="font-size: x-small;">1</span>. Overall, I really like it, and these are just my thoughts about it. First the bad things:<p /><div><b>Bad</b></div><div><ul><li>The Resolution. The iPhone 4&#39;s resolution is more than half of the laptop&#39;s 1280x800 pixels. Apple has always had crappy resolutions on their notebooks (unless you&#39;re shelling out more than $2k).</li> <li>The keyboard is weird. No right-control, no forward delete, no page-up, page-down, home, or end. There are workarounds, but I miss those guys. This is also keeping me from getting the bluetooth keyboard; same layout.</li> <li>Slooooow hard drive. On the 13&quot; it was either a 5400rpm one or an expensive solid state. And the store didn&#39;t have and SSD ones on hand.</li></ul><div><b>Good</b></div><div><ul><li>The trackpad. I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of trackpads, but I&#39;m really digging this one. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because this trackpad is huge, or the multi-touch capabilities (or both), but I only miss a mouse when needing finer cursor management.</li> <li>The battery. It lasts between 6-8 hours, easy. How do you not like that? Some people whine about the lack of an interchangable battery, but I don&#39;t care about that.</li><li>Construction. I think the quality of the build is just ridiculous. The iMac is good, but this feels better. I get a feeling that Apple cares a little more about their line of notebooks than their desktops. It&#39;s also pretty light, to the point that I wonder if the MacBook Air would be worth it.</li> </ul><p /></div><p /><div><ol><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that running Lightroom and Photoshop is just ridiculously slow on both this and my iMac, but programming is pleasurable. Isn&#39;t that backwards? Macs are for creative fluff and PCs are for coding...</span></li> </ol></div></div>
