I&#39;ve posted a couple of quotes recently that on the surface seem to be a little depressing. However, it&#39;s quotes like these that motivate me. I <i>want</i> to be the best that I can at photography. Thus, I&#39;ll read and soak up as much information as I can regarding it. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a steady stream of people willing to be photographed, so when I do get the itch, I&#39;ll end up doing a semi-dorky self-portrait.<p /><div>Most importantly, when I am doing a picture of someone else, I want to take the absolute best picture in my whole life, and feel disappointment if at the end of the day I haven&#39;t produced that. </div>
